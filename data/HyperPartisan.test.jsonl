{"label": "false", "text": "WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - The White House initially said Trump fired Comey over his handling of the Hillary Clinton private email server investigation, however, later the US president stated that when he decided to dismiss Comey, he was thinking of the Russia investigation. US President Donald Trump said in a statement on Thursday that he did not fire former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey because of the Russia investigation. Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true! In an interview with NBC News' Lester Holt in May 2017, Trump said he was thinking about \"this Russia thing\" when he decided to fire Comey.

Russian officials have repeatedly denied allegations of interference, calling the accusations groundless and absurd. Trump has also denied any collusion with the Kremlin and has called Mueller's investigation \"a witch hunt.\""}

Senate Republicans weren't able to muster enough votes to pass their skinny repeal of Obamacare. Senators voted 49-51 shortly before 2:00 a.m. Friday morning. Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) cast a surprise \"no\" vote. He was joined by GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Susan Collins (Maine). The bill, titled the Health Care Freedom Act, would have repealed the individual insurance mandate. It would also have repealed the employer mandate for eight years. GOP leaders and Vice President Mike Pence huddled with McCain, Murkowski and Collins before the vote, which was stalled for nearly an hour. A few minutes before the vote, McCain crossed the chamber to huddle with Democrats. McCain's \"no\" vote came as a shock to many. Democrats applauded the move on Twitter. The vote is a devastating blow for Republicans who have fought for months to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and will likely have to start the process all over again. \"This is clearly a disappointing moment,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said shortly after the final vote tally was called. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer admitted that the current health care law is not perfect and called for Republicans and Democrats to work together to fix the problems with Obamacare. Other memorable moments from the health care debate: Now the Senate will move on to the defense budget."}

This was especially true during true during FS1\u2019s Undisputed with Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe. As the FS1 Dynamic Duo began discussing the topic, Sharpe went on an incredible eight-minute rant on how NFL owners suddenly got an awakening about President Trump\u2019s comments at an Alabama rally about players who kneel during the national anthem. Sharpe first said he was \u201cdisappointed and \u2026 unimpressed,\u201d about the whole thing. And then he expressed why he was disappointed and unimpressed: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed, Skip and Joy, because this is the tipping point. Of the 7,537 things that President Trump has said in the last 50 years, him calling an NFL player a \u2018SOB\u2019 is what brought the NFL, the owners and players together. And while some might be moved by the conscience of these NFL owners, it wasn\u2019t their conscience that moved them. It was the cash. Because see Skip, what we know about people with money, they don\u2019t like to be told what to do\u2026they don\u2019t like being bullied. You see, President Trump has bullied a lot of people \u2026\u201d Sharpe then mentioned Trump\u2019s comments on Mexico, attacking a Gold Star family after last year\u2019s Democratic National Convention, and his statements to former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush about women saying, \u201cthat did not shock the conscience of NFL owners.\u201d And he also pointed out a number of owners, including Jerry Jones, Daniel Snyder, Shad Khan, and Robert Kraft, who contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cNow I\u2019m unimpressed because this wasn\u2019t a protest. This was unity. So what are we showing solidarity against, Skip? We\u2019re showing solidarity because President Trump .. he challenged the very men \u2026 wealthy, wealthy men \u2026 billionaires and he told them what you should do if someone protests, you should fire them. They don\u2019t like being told what to do, Skip. \u201cAnd then, Skip, he called players that protested the anthem \u2026 he called them \u2018SOB\u2019s.\u2019 Think about that now, he called them \u2018SOB\u2019s.\u2019 That\u2019s what got the owners, that\u2019s what got the players to unite. \u201cIs that the worst that he\u2019s ever said? Absolutely not. Never called Vladimir Putin an \u2018SOB,\u2019 Never called (Erdogan) of Turkey an \u2018SOB,\u2019 even those men that walked down the streets in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2026 he never said \u2018SOB\u2019 \u2026\u201d This was an impassioned Sharpe. He also pointed out Colin Kaepernick, who started the kneeling during the national anthem, was forgotten and the NFL owners were uniting against Donald Trump. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until he came for the NFL that their conscience was shocked!\u201d Sharpe said of all the teams that issued statements this weekend, only the Seattle Seahawks got the reason why they were denouncing the President\u2019s statements. And he also set his sights on fellow FS1 analyst Ray Lewis for previously criticizing Kaepernick and then kneeling on the sideline with the Baltimore Ravens in London on Sunday. Sharpe said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in him, saying Lewis \u201csat in that chair right there saying that he could never kneel, never not stand for the national anthem\u201d citing those who died fighting for the flag and then he went down on both knees. \u201cWhat are you kneeling for?\u201d It was one of the more emotional segments on Undisputed in its brief history."}
{"label": "true", "text": "In his election campaign, Mr Trump was clear about his desire to build a \"great great\" wall along the border of the US and Mexico which he believes will bring an end to illegal immigration from South and Central America. LBC presenter Ian Collins received a call from Mexican Josephine, who explained why she could not wait for work to begin on the wall. Josephine believes people from her native country are victimised because the Mexican government does not do enough for their people and have no authority when it comes to handling crime, especially in relation to drugs. She said: \u201cWe get the blame for all these criminals. \u201cThe Mexican government has turned a blind eye and the war has been lost with the drugs. \u201cMany areas of Mexico have become worse than Chicago. \u201cPeople are shooting themselves... they look after their family and they have machine guns and they drive around in trucks.\u201d Collins then asked: \u201cSo you\u2019re saying Donald Trump wasn\u2019t being a racist then?

{"label": "true", "text": "Methinks she doth protest too much -- and too late. Those who condemned President Trump for not condemning white supremacist groups quickly and forcefully enough after Charlottesville have no problem with Hillary Clinton taking five full days to hypocritically condemn sexual predator Harvey Weinstein. Maybe she was pondering the similarities between Weinstein\u2019s predatory activities and that of her husband. Both used their positions of power to extort sexual favors, sometimes forcibly, from women. And just as Hollywood looked the other way for the sake of career advancement so too did Hillary Clinton as she rode her husband\u2019s attained coattails to political prominence. So her recent expression of disgust over Weinstein\u2019s activities ring hollow: At long last, the people who do the strategic planning for Hillary Clinton and tell her what emotions she should imitate in response to various stimuli have weighed in and they have decided that Harvey Weinstein is not a nice man: \u201cI was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein. The behavior described by the women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior...\u201d Hillary Clinton knew who and what Weinstein was as surely as she knew and knows what Bill Clinton is. Weinstein has been joined at the hip with the Clintons for a couple of decades\u2026 Ironically, as it turns out, he was a major defender of Bill Clinton in the Lewinski affair though Weinstein seemed to favor aiming at the ficus bushes rather than blue dresses. At the same time, mind you, that Hillary Clinton was active in directing a campaign to paint the battalion of women who had been sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton as morally decrepit if not outright crazy. Between Hillary\u2019s campaigns and the Clinton Foundation (out of curiosity, is the FBI still investigating this?) she has benefited from as much as a quarter million dollars from Weinstein. Hollywood was a major funder of both the Clinton and Obama political machines, and many a Hollywood star defended Bill Clinton\u2019s sordid activities as a personal matter as long as he was doing a good job as President. They similarly defended Weinstein as Michelle Obama once did, as a \u201cwonderful human being\u201d, as well as \u201ca good friend and just a powerhouse\u201d Both the Obamas and Clintons knew Weinstein well and neither should be given a pass for feigning ignorance and shock at his activities: None other than CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on Tuesday evening that former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama should not get a \u201cpass\u201d on Harvey Weinstein. In fact, Toobin said their association with Weinstein throughout the years is a \u201cdark mark on their record.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we can give the Clintons and the Obamas a pass here,\u201d Toobin said on Anderson Cooper 360. He cited Seth MacFarlane\u2019s creepy joke about Weinstein at an Oscars event and added that MacFarlane\u2019s joke illustrated that \u201ca lot of people knew or had very strong suspicions that this was a very bad guy.\u201d \u201cThe Obamas and the Clintons embraced him, did fundraisers with him, paid tribute to him,\u201d Toobin continued. \u201cI think it\u2019s a dark mark on their record\u2026\u201d The Obamas also finally said on record that they were \u201cdisgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein.\u201d \u201cMichelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein,\u201d the Obamas said in a statement. \u201cAny man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status. We should celebrate the courage of women who have come forward to tell these painful stories. And we all need to build a culture -- including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect -- so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future\u2026\u201d As Breitbart News has reported, Weinstein visited the Obama White House on at least 13 occasions and Obama\u2019s daughter, Malia Obama, \u201crecently wrapped up an internship at the New York City offices of The Weinstein Co.\u201d Right. Perhaps Weinstein wanted to see where Bill Clinton dropped his cigar in the Oval Office. Hillary, of course, should be all too familiar with Harvey Weinstein\u2019s despicable behavior. She watched her husband do the same and worse for decades as she also allegedly fought for women\u2019s rights, except for the right of their victims to leave the room unmolested. Hillary famously said that all claims of rape, abuse, and harassment should be deemed credible and be believed until proven otherwise. It seems there was an exception for her husband, an exception required by her need to ride his coattails to power, just as Hollywood excused Weinstein because he could advance or kill the careers of those he exploited. Gennifer Flowers, Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey as well as, some would suggest, a cast of thousands, have been groped, fondled, and used as sexual objects by one William Jefferson Clinton. Was Hillary appalled and shocked at her husband\u2019s predatory activities or did she blame it on that \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d? And then there\u2019s Juanita Broaddrick, who has accused President Clinton of rape. Juanita Broaddrick\u2019s story is a credible one, and one of the many \u201c bimbo eruptions\u201d that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton handled during her husband Bill\u2019s presidential campaign As Linda Tripp, confidante of former Clinton intern Monica Lewinsky, told the Daily Mail of how Hillary both enabled and covered up Bill\u2019s many dalliances: Tripp said: 'His political success was largely dependent upon Hillary. He owed her a great deal. As is widely acknowledged, Hillary took care of all the 'bimbo eruptions' of which there were thousands in order to present to the world an electable candidate. 'In this endeavor she was ruthless. She destroyed women so that their stories never saw the light of day.' So much for fighting for women\u2019s rights. At a Trump press conference in 2016, Broaddrick, tired of being accused of being part of that vast right-wing conspiracy, and afraid that her attacker would once again occupy the White House with the woman who orchestrated the attacks on Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d, repeated her accusation: \u201cActions speak louder than words,\u201d Broaddrick said. \u201cMr. Trump may have said some bad words but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any comparison.\u201d Broaddrick, who has said Hillary threatened her, appeared with fellow Clinton sexual assault victims Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey appeared in an interview at presidential suite of the historic Watergate and related the taleof Bill\u2019s assaults and their fear of Hillary\u2019s retaliation: In an exclusive video interview at the presidential suite of the historic Watergate Hotel, the victims of Bill Clinton\u2019s alleged sexual assault -- Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, and Paula Jones -- got together for the first time in person to express their personal fear of Hillary Clinton and to warn voters that Clinton does not stand for women\u2019s issues.. The three women, who say their lives were forever changed by their experiences with the Clintons, used words like \u201cterrified\u201d and \u201cfrightened\u201d to describe their feelings about the prospects of a Hillary Clinton presidency\u2026 \u201cWe were not willing participants,\u201d Broaddrick said. \u201cThese were crimes.\u201d In a separate interview, Broaddrick shared her own story of brutal sexual assault which she says Bill Clinton perpetrated against her. Willey called out NBC News\u2019 Andrea Mitchell and CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper by name, challenging them: \u201cThese are not infidelities. A rape is not an infidelity. These are crimes. Any other people would be in jail\u2026 \u201cThis is no longer about infidelities, indiscretions, girlfriends, sex, interns -- none of those. This is about a serial rapist, a predator, and his wife who has enabled his behavior all of these years.\u201d Later in this interview, Jones, Willey, and Broaddrick expressed fear at how a potential President Hillary Clinton would use the power of her office. \u201cIt terrifies me and it should terrify all women,\u201d Jones stated about Hillary\u2019s presidential ambitions. \u201cIt should terrify all men and women,\u201d Willey added. \u201cShe will annihilate any enemy. All of her enemies. Anybody who has spoken against her. Across the board for I don\u2019t know how many years. She will get rid of them.\u201d \u201cNo woman who advocates for women attacks the victims of sexual assault be it by her husband or anybody else,\u201d said Willey. The women argued that the term \u201cenabler\u201d best describes Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in her husband\u2019s alleged sexual crimes. Harvey Weinstein and Bill Clinton \u2013 sexual predators separated at birth. Hillary and Hollywood knew them and their activities full well and tolerated them for similar reasons. We should be appalled, if not shocked, at their craven hypocrisy as both have waged a sick and depraved and very real war on women.

{"label": "false", "text": "UPDATE May 22, 2018: The Little Rock Police Department has recovered human remains in Chalamont Park, the last place Ebby Steppach was seen. May 25, 2017: Crime Watch Daily joins in the hunt for a missing Arkansas teenager whose parents fear she may have been kidnapped and forced into the dark world of sex-trafficking. Ebby Steppach, 18, was planning to go to the Little Rock Police Department to report an alleged sexual assault. But before she could make talk to cops -- she vanished. She's a young woman who has become famous in Little Rock, Arkansas for all the wrong reasons. \"Everyone knows Ebby,\" said KARK-TV reporter Mitch McCoy. \"Ebby is the 'Little Rock Girl.' You can say the name Ebby Steppach and most people will know who you're talking about.\" She went to a house party to kick off the weekend. But that was the end of the good times for 18-year-old Ebby. \"Ebby went to a party on a Friday night and had been assaulted, and there was a videotape,\" said Ebby's mother Laurie Jernigan. And it's the beginning of a nightmare for her and her family. \"She got extremely upset about it and was threatening to go to the police about it. And then two days later she disappears? Yes.\" And now only Crime Watch Daily tracks down a key witness who sheds light on the frightening possibilities. Laurie Jernigan says her daughter Ebby is a joy to have around. But Ebby has an independent streak too. \"When she started pushing the boundaries, it was 'I have a car of my own, I should be able to come home when I want,'\" said Laurie. When Ebby got that first car, a whole new world opened up, and she's taking the ride all the way. \"She didn't realize the danger,\" said Laurie. One night Ebby heads to a party in Little Rock. \"She did have bad influences on her life, some that I didn't know,\" said Laurie. The next morning Ebby sends a frightening text message to her friend Gage Fulton. Gage read the text out loud on a phone call to private investigator Monty Vickers, who recorded the conversation. \"I was hanging with some dudes last night and we smoked and I had sex with one of them and he [----]ing recorded me dude, like when I wasn't looking.\" Videotaped during a sexual encounter -- Ebby doesn't tell Gage who did it. But he tells Vickers that she is horrified and confused. Vickers: \"Did she tell you that she was raped?\" Fulton: \"She said she felt forced into it. Her last text message to me is 'I am going to go kill myself.'\" But Ebby doesn't kill herself. She is enraged, and plans to do something about it. That same night, she again sends a text, this time to her stepfather Michael Jernigan while he is at dinner with the family. \"An incident had occurred at that party that she wanted to discuss, and discuss with the police,\" said Michael Jernigan. \"There had been an encounter with a particular individual at that party that he had videotaped.\" Michael leaves a message with Ebby that he's heading to her grandparents' house where she is staying. But he gets no response. \"I called over to her grandparents to ask if she was over there. They stated that she left, said that she was going to meet me,\" said Michael. But Michael says there hadn't been an arrangement to meet anywhere. And it is the last contact he ever has with his stepdaughter. But suddenly the family hears from Ebby the next day when she answers a phone call from her brother Trevor. Like everyone else he has been trying desperately to reach her. \"She answered and he said 'Where are you?' And she said 'I'm out in front of your house,'\" said Laurie Jernigan. \"So he hung up and says cool and he goes out there and she's not there. So he calls her back. She answers and she says she's messed up and he said 'Where are you?' And she said 'I'm in my car,' and he said 'Where is your car?' And she said 'I don't know,' and hung up. And that's the last time anyone's talked to her.\" And now the family is truly alarmed and terrified for the fate of their Ebby. \"He called the police immediately, and he said 'You've got to look for her car. I know something is wrong. Something's happened,'\" said Laurie. \"They listed her as a runaway and they weren't going to look for her.\" No possibility that she just decided to leave town on her own for whatever reason? \"She would move out and hang out, which was really unusual, but she would never run away and not talk to her family,\" said Laurie. And Ebby's family is searching for her everywhere. Until days after her disappearance, they suddenly get news that leaves them thunderstruck once more. Ebby's abandoned car is reported at a nearby city park by security guard Guy Hooper. A surveillance image shows her car on the road shortly after she went missing. But police are not saying exactly where or if anyone was in the car with her. \"I called Little Rock and notified them that the car had been sitting there for three days, and they had gotten the car and taken it in,\" said Guy Hooper. \"It was devastating. I can't describe to you how bad that was that night. Finding her car and not her, you might as well tell me she was dead. It was unimaginable,\" said Laurie. And what police find in her car only deepens the family's fear that something terrible has happened to Ebby. \"What 18-year-old leaves her cellphone or their clothes? Her makeup? She spent all of her money on makeup. Her contact lenses, she can't see without contacts,\" said Laurie. But Laurie says she still cannot convince police that Ebby is a victim of foul play and not a runaway. \"No matter how hard I tried I could not get detectives to do anything about it,\" said Laurie. Not only that, Ebby's family says they still don't know if some of the people who were with her at that party have even been questioned by police. Stepdad Michael Jernigan says Ebby gave him some names in that last text conversation, but he will not reveal them for fear of jeopardizing the ongoing investigation. \"I know two of the individuals,\" said Michael. Do the police know who they are? \"Yes.\" Ebby Steppach, 18, has been missing for weeks after disappearing on Oct. 25, 2015. And the alarming possibility that she has been sex-trafficked haunts everyone who knows this case. How does the sex-trafficking work? \"They pick up this girl, lock her up in a room, feed her with heroin, keep her doped up,\" said private investigator Monty Vickers. \"They charge guys to have sex with her, to the point where she is just a zombie slave.\" The best-case scenario is Ebby is still alive, but being sex-trafficked. \"That's the worst-case scenario to me,\" said Ebby's mother Laurie. \"If she's not with us anymore, she's in peace.\" The search for any sign of her goes on, with no results. Ebby's family hires private investigator and former Little Rock Police detective Monty Vickers. He says he tries to help the department work better with the family. \"The last thing that we need to do is to run out here and start our own investigation and interfere with the police investigation in some way, so we basically did nothing other than try to communicate with the police department and stay in communication with the family,\" said Vickers. But he still does a lot of digging himself. About five months after Ebby goes missing, he visits security guard Guy Hooper, the man who reported Ebby's abandoned car at a city park. We tracked down Guy Hooper ourselves, and he gave us the shocking details about seeing Ebby with two young black men in the park only days before she disappeared. \"It was late evening, I advised them all, everybody to leave the park, which they did,\" said Hooper. \"Then a few days later I run into her again with another young black gentleman. This time they were in the back seat of the car. And the third time she was back with another couple gentlemen.\" He's sure it was Ebby? \"Yes sir,\" said Hooper. \"After I saw the pictures of her later on, of course -- I didn't have a name at the time.\" And Hooper says he notices one guy in particular, who he says is there all three times. \"They were hugging, kissing back and forth,\" said Hooper. Does he remember what these guys looked like, especially the one she was close to? \"He was about five-foot-six, five-seven, had long dreads,\" said And his eyewitness account is about to go ballistic when we show him what we've brought along with us. There was a bust involving sex-trafficking that took place in Louisiana but the individuals that were arrested many of them have connection to Little Rock. We showed Hooper their mug shots to see if he recognized any of them. \"It's this middle one on the top and the gentleman on the left,\" said Hooper. Which individual was the one kissing and hugging Ebby? \"This gentleman right here, the guy with the dreads,\" said Hooper. How positive is Hooper? \"About 70 percent. I'm pretty sure this was the gentleman that was directly with her,\" said Hooper. It is a stunning development that could have a major impact on the search for Ebby. The man with the dreadlocks is Keith Pruiett, 21, of Little Rock. Police in Arkansas have not connected him with Ebby's disappearance. But Pruiett was recently charged with human-trafficking and promoting prostitution near Shreveport, Louisiana. Also charged in that case in Louisiana is 23-year-old Gary Jackson of Little Rock. Gus Hooper also pointed out Jackson as the second man he believes he saw in the park with Ebby. Both men are currently in jail in Louisiana awaiting trial, and we have been not been able to contact them or anyone representing them. Little Rock Police have not named either man, or any suspects, in Ebby Steppach's disappearance. We don't know if the Little Rock Police Department has ever seen the potential bombshell evidence that Crime Watch Daily has brought to the table. So Crime Watch Daily went right over to the station and hand it to them personally. We couldn't get the lieutenant or a detective on camera, but we ran into Public Information Officer Steve Moore out front. \"I'm trying to find him and I'm going to call the assigned detective and give him this also,\" Moore said. Police say they are actively pursuing the information we provided them. \"I think there's a lot more to the story,\" said KARK-TV's Mitch McCoy. McCoy from has been on the story since Ebby first went missing. \"I think that there are a lot of unknowns with this case that sooner or later will come out. The question is when,\" said McCoy. McCoy interviewed retired detective Tommy Hudson, who recently worked on the case. Today Hudson says the investigation is back on track. He won't discuss sex-trafficking, but he does lean toward foul play. \"My opinion is is somebody has her and somebody's done something to her,\" McCoy tells Crime Watch Daily. And Ebby's family says that they are now satisfied that police are doing everything possible to find their daughter. \"I have full confidence in who has her case now,\" said Ebby's mother Laurie Jernigan. \"I can actually sleep at night knowing that there are those looking for her. Thank God we have someone now, we have people now that understand that and check on that as soon as they can.\" Ebby Steppach stands 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs about 110 pounds. She also may have dyed her blond hair black after her disappearance."}

{"label": "true", "text": "The State Department argued at a federal hearing Thursday that its ability to process the 100,000 Hillary Clinton emails ordered released under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit has been hindered by a lack of manpower due to a \"hiring freeze\" and that the urgency to release the documents has been diminished by the public's lack of interest in the subject, according to the watchdog group that won the lawsuit for the document's release. But Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group that sued the State Department in May 2015 for the thousands of emails and documents, isn't buying it. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton is accusing the State Department of slow-rolling the emails being sent from the FBI to the State Department, a large number of which Clinton \"failed to disclose\" to the government when she served as secretary of state, he said. On July 15, the FBI allegedly turned over to the State Department a new disk of emails belonging to former Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The emails were apparently discovered on a laptop owned by Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. Weiner pleaded guilty in May to sending a number of text messages and sexually explicit pictures last year to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. There apparently are 7,000 emails from Abedin on Weiner's laptop, said Fitton, who added that State Department and Justice Department lawyers are \"claiming they have to appraise them, whether they are personal or government, and then sift through what can be shared publicly.\" State Department spokeswoman Pooja Jhunjhunwala told Circa \"\u200ethe Department takes its records management responsibilities seriously and is working diligently to process FOIA requests and to balance the demands of the many requests we have received.\" \"We are devoting significant resources to meeting our litigation obligations,\" she added. The State Department was ordered in November to process documents at the rate of 500 pages per month, but \"at that rate it would take until 2020 for the bulk to made public,\" Fitton said. So far, the State Department has produced 17 batches of documents, Fitton said. \"President Trump needs to direct his agencies to follow the the law but right now they are making a mockery of it by saying they won't finish releasing it until 2020,\" said Fitton, whose group will be heading back to court three months from now to assess the progress. \"I can understand the president's frustration because he wanted these made public. However, his Justice and State departments are making excuses of why they have to slow-roll it this way.\" Trump has made numerous assertions about Clinton and her email server. In June, he tweeted that Clinton destroyed her phones and \"bleached\" her emails. But the president's own Justice Department civil attorneys argued Thursday that there was \"diminished public interest\" in the emails. A U.S. official familiar with the case and the agencies told Circa on the condition that they not be named that \"there are still holdovers within the departments that don't want to see these emails released, so slow-rolling these requests makes perfect sense. If the president wants these emails released then he will have to demand that the agencies abide.\" Last week, Judicial Watch released 448 pages of documents the State Department did turn over from Abedin, describing what it said was preferential treatment \"to major donors to the Clinton Foundation and political campaigns,\" according to the group. \"The documents included six Clinton email exchanges not previously turned over to the State Department, bringing the known total to date to at least 439 emails that were not part of the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department, and further contradicting a statement by Clinton that, ' as far as she knew,' all of her government emails had been turned over to the State Department,\" the watchdog group stated in a July 14 press release."}

{"label": "false", "text": "President Barack Obama is set to speak at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night. Obama will take the stage 12 years after he first came to national attention as a freshman senator from Illinois at his party's 2004 convention. Ostensibly, Obama was there to endorse Massachusetts senator John Kerry for his White House bid. But it's best remembered as the launching-point of Obama's own run four years later. John Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper, for alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga, a belief that we're all connected as one people. If there is a child on the South Side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me even if it's not my child. If there is a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs and are having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer even if it's not my grandparent. If there is an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. It is that fundamental belief -- it is that fundamental belief -- I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper -- that makes this country work. It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, and yet still come together as one American family. \"E pluribus unum;\" \"out of many, one.\" Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us; the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight there is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America. There's the United States of America. The pundits -- the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states, red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too: we worship an awesome God in the blue states and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach little league in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America. In the end -- in the end -- in the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism, or do we participate in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here, the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it, or a health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs. The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores. The hope of a young Naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta. The hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds. The hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him too. ( Hope -- hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope. In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation, a belief in things not seen; a belief that there are better days ahead. I believe that we can give our middle class relief, and provide working families with a road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs, and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us. America, tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president, and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president, and this country will reclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness, a brighter day will come. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you."}
{"label": "true", "text": "Recently, Erin Elizabeth from HealthNutNews wrote up an expose about the past year\u2019s findings concerning the many disappearances of holistic doctors. In case you\u2019re not aware, the confusing conundrum first began when Dr. Bradstreet was found dead exactly one year ago \u2013 yes, on Father\u2019s Day \u2013 in the U.S. The noted autism doctor, researcher, and parent was found in a river with a gunshot wound to the chest. While authorities at first thought his death was a result of suicide, it has since been confirmed that Dr. Bradstreet was murdered and that the wound was not self-inflicted. His family, like the families of many other missing and dead naturopathic practitioners and MD doctors, believe that he was murdered for using and promoting controversial therapies, such as GCMaF. According to Elizabeth, nearly 50 doctors have now died or gone missing under mysterious circumstances. This riveting finding has resulted in some exposure on the topic \u2013 including articles by the New York Times, The Independent UK, and network affiliates such as ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, but the whole story \u2013 or the many threads connecting the various murders\u2013 is not being told. For this reason, the activist took to the internet today, on the one-year-anniversary of the first of the mysterious deaths, to express how serious of a concern these events are. Right now in the United States, consumers are being told that they are not enough and that they must purchase more items on credit, eat high-fat, high-sugar foods, take prescription pills they cannot afford, and buy into the fear-mongering propaganda. In effect, America \u2013 perceived to be one of the most \u201cdeveloped\u201d nations in the world \u2013 spends more on \u2018health care\u2019 than any other affluent nation, yet still has the worst state of health as a collective. Many suspect this is because a small elite controls the majority of corporations and mediaand, in effect, the government. Unhealthy ideals are being pushed on the public for the sake of profit. In fact, according to one Berkeley doctor, conventional treatments for concerns such as cancer are less effective than forgoing treatment in the first place. Of course, if the public knew that eating healthier, getting exercise, thinking positive thoughts, simplifying their life, and letting go of toxic people and situations would dramatically transform their health, the world would be a much different place. It seems that health practitioners that promote the idea that every individual can be their own doctor by taking responsibility for their own health rather than waiting for emergency medicine are being targeted, as they are going against a system which is corrupt and toxic. Click KEEP READING to read the full story. Or, at least, that\u2019s what Elizabeth\u2019s findings have concluded. The activist\u2019s attention on this topic may have earned her \u2013 and her colleagues \u2013 death threats, but the efforts have paid off. A documentary is actually being made to shed more light on the mysterious deaths, and more information on that up-and-coming film will soon be shared. Below is a detailed timeline of 34 doctors\u2019 deaths within the last year. We\u2019ll let you be the judge on whether or not the untimely demise of many of these practitioners is fate or suspect. What matters most is that if these doctors were killed because they\u2019re practicing true medicine, the injustice is uncovered and the parties responsible pay for their crimes. Dr. Bradstreet formerly of Florida, and now practicing in Georgia, was found with a gunshot wound to his chest in a river. The small town locals ruled the death almost immediately as a suicide, but many have their doubts. This same day in Mexico, June 19th, 2015, three doctors were traveling to the State Capital to deliver some papers and were reported missing. This is the only case outside of the U.S. Authorities said they found the bodies, but the families say those bodies look nothing like their family members and they are demanding more proof and more testing. A sad but riveting article was written about those details here. I also did an exclusive interview with the Bradstreet family as they publicly said I was the only journalist they trusted to talk about the horrific incident. Father\u2019s Day, Florida East Coast: Two chiropractors are found dead. Their names are Dr. Baron Holt and Dr. Bruce Hendendal, both fathers. Dr. Hedendal also held a PhD in nutrition from Harvard. Both were presumably healthy and described as very fit. There is still no cause of death listed, for either doctor in any articles we find. A few people have contacted me about Dr. Hedendal, 67, but admit that they were surprised by his death and still find it shocking. (Update: Family and loved ones of Dr. Hedendal have spoken to the media that they are suspicious of his death and want answers. Interestingly, Dr. Holt (33), lived in North Carolina which is the state where Dr. Bradstreet\u2019s body (the first doctor to be found) was discovered two days prior. Dr. Holt was visiting Jacksonville, Florida, though, when he died there. Dr. Bradstreet (see story #1) was living in Georgia at the time of his death and before that he lived in the neighboring state of Florida. A few mutual friends of Dr. Holt have contacted me. They are doctors and have shared with me a cause of death that I find rather shocking and cannot confirm, therefore, out of respect for the family, I will not list that here. Both were well loved by their patients, community, friends and family.) The beloved holistic Theresa Sievers, MD was found murdered in her home. Her co-worker says she was known as the \u201cMother Teresa of South Florida.\u201d Her husband and children were in Connecticut at a family reunion when she was murdered. The authorities have been investigating for two weeks \u201caround the clock,\u201d and now say that she was targeted. Her murder was not random nor was it a home invasion and when the facts come out, \u201cbooks and movies will be written about it.\u201d It\u2019s that big of a story. On the very same day, June 29th, Jeffrey Whiteside, MD, a pulmonologist, went missing- vanishing when he simply \u201cwalked away\u201d. Dr. Whiteside, known for his successful treatment of lung cancer, disappeared in Door County, Wisconsin while vacationing with family. He was on foot and numerous reports have called it \u201cmysterious,\u201d saying he vanished without a trace. They\u2019ve been searching now for three weeks and even colleagues have joined in (along with bloodhounds, drones search parties, and helicopters) but not one shred of evidence has surfaced. (UPDATE: Two arrests were made in the death of Teresa Sievers and one of the assailants called himself the \u201cHammer\u201d on Facebook (Dr. Sievers was allegedly killed with a hammer). The other was one of her husband\u2019s childhood friends who was just recently extradited to Florida. His attorney says there is evidence to show he had no involvement whatsoever with the crime. Her husband, Mark Sievers, has not been arrested at this time.) Patrick Fitzpatrick, MD goes missing. He was traveling from North Dakota to neighboring Montana (which he did often as his son lives there) and his truck and trailer were found on the side of the road. The search has expanded but authorities say it\u2019s as if he vanished without a trace. He\u2019s 6\u2032 tall and described as Irish-looking with a goatee (details can be found in the links). Lisa Riley, 34 years old, DO (Doctor of Osteopathic medicine) is found in her home with a gunshot wound to her head. Her husband who found her and called 911, has a prior record. He was previously charged with the attempted murder of his ex, Ms. King, before charges were eventually dropped. Evidence showed that there was gun residue found on Ms. King\u2019s hand and not Mr. Riley\u2019s. Riley\u2019s story corroborated this, but King\u2019s allegedly didn\u2019t, and her story kept changing (click link in this paragraph for their story with details on all of this). Mr. Riley has since been charged with the death of his wife, Lisa Riley. We\u2019ll see what happens in court. Prev Next A month to the day after the first doctor (Jeff Bradstreet, MD) was found dead with a gunshot wound to his chest, Dr. Ron Schwartz was found murdered in his E. Coast Florida home.Sadly, he was shot to death. We don\u2019t know if he was holistic, but he was licensed and lived between Florida and Georgia. He was a gynecologist who lived in an unincorporated part of Jupiter, Florida on a few acres of land and there are reports he ran an organic lawn service on the side. Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez, a holistic MD, dies suddenly. The same day another holistic doctor is also found dead (see below). They both allegedly died of heart attacks, though their own friends and family say publicly it doesn\u2019t add up. I had met Dr Gonzalez and his amazing wife, and my better half has interviewed him several times. His official website says that while they initially thought it was a heart attack, his autopsy does not support that belief and shows no heart attack. They are awaiting further tests. \u201cDr Gonzalez was in excellent health otherwise so his passing is quite unexpected.\u201d It is reported that he was alone at the time of his death. Countless people every week (including close friends) write me questioning the fact that he died \u201cnaturally\u201d. He also said in several interviews (including the last one before he died) that he thought big pharma wanted him to get hit by a bus or that he might die suddenly. Frightening metaphors and a mystery we hope to get to the bottom of soon. Dr Abdul Karim, an outspoken and loved holistic (biological) dentist, 41 years of age, is found dead alongside the road by a passerby. He had been preparing for a half marathon and was allegedly out training that night. His old fraternity brother (lifelong friends), friends of many years, and patients said it didn\u2019t add up. He was in perfect shape and ate an extremely healthy diet. Mainstream news said he had a \u201cmassive heart attack\u201d but many who knew him have written to me with their sincere doubts. Authorities announce they have found the body of Dr Jeffrey Whiteside who has been missing for over 3 weeks. Chief Deputy Pat McCarty said at the news conference on Thursday that a .22 caliber gun was recovered at the scene. Investigators believe the body was there for \u201csome time\u201d. Osteopath Mary Bovier is found slain to death in her home in Pennsylvania. Her significant other, who we are told is also an osteopath, was questioned and released. At this time there have been no arrests and there are no suspects. I report that Jeffrey Whiteside\u2019s death is officially ruled as a suicide but the local press calls the investigation a \u201cmess\u201d (described here in detail). Many are shocked at how long it took for details to emerge and countless people write me with their doubts. Even local authorities were asked by the local press if they\u2019d heard of my stories. They admitted they had, but hadn\u2019t been contacted by the feds on the case. I broke the news to the health community of 29 holistic doctors (also referred to in the German press as homeopaths/ND\u2019s/psychiatrists) who were found poisoned by an overdose of a hallucinogenic drug. I\u2019ve done several updates of the articles, using a German translator, but the whole story of what really happened has still not been revealed. One thing most can agree on; it was a large overdose and mainstream German news reports that some were in \u201clife threatening situations\u201d when dozens of ambulances and a helicopter arrived to the chaotic scene. The good news? All lived and have allegedly made a full recovery (though some had to be restrained for their safety for some time). I reported that our colleague, best selling author and holistic MD, Mitch Gaynor, is found dead outside his country home; an hour or so from Manhattan where he practiced. We knew Dr Gaynor and had just finished an advanced copy of his book that he had sent to us. It was quickly called a suicide by the local sheriff. The NY Times wrote me asking for details and we had a nice exchange. Even though I have gently broken the news on this and many other stories, the NY Times fails to source me (I didn\u2019t expect them to source HealthNutNews, though the Guardian UK and other mainstream sources have for some time). UPDATE: Mitch Gaynor, MD had been on RT not long before he died. We wanted to contact them for comment, but soon after Mitch was found dead? the founder of RT was found dead in his Washington DC hotel room. We announce that Dr Marie Paas is found dead of an alleged suicide. She was well known for her animal advocacy. People on her Facebook page seemed shocked and in disbelief about her death. Unlike the 3 others by this date who were alleged suicides (one who has been officially confirmed) we don\u2019t know the location where Dr Paas was found, nor the details of her alleged suicide. Many seem concerned for her pets, who they say she loved very much. Prev Next Jerome E. Block, M.D, jumped to his death from Central Park West residence. Authorities say Block jumped from the 20th floor of his residence around 9:30 a.m. Details and video can be found here. ;besides the 13 doctors covered thus far who died in non accidental deaths, we have 5 chiropractor deathsthat were accidents. We also have more deaths of doctors here: some described as freak accidents. Again, we didn\u2019t include them in the official unintended series. We have the famous holistic ABC News doctor, Jamie Zimmerman, who allegedly slipped and fell and hit her head in Hawaii while on vacation, and who was carried out to sea. We also have more accidental deaths of holistic doctors here in NY (accidental), and yet another here of a famous holistic MD! We literally couldn\u2019t keep up at times there were so many. January 2016 I didn\u2019t include PhD\u2019s in the series (unless they were also an MD, DO or DC) but then just this past few weeks we saw 2 Canadian PhD\u2019s/researchers killed. One was stabbed in what his friends called a safe neighborhood. Another, a Phd (who was a wife and mother of two) was hit while jogging near the beach and then buried in a shallow grave on the tourist island of Grenada. Then days later a holistic doctor is also attacked there with his wife (physician\u2019s assistant) on this same tiny island of Grenada (see #18). This is where we suddenly start seeing a spate of cancer researchers killed which hadn\u2019t happened previously and then suddenly we have a one every few days. A top MD, John Marshall, 49, who was a former 4th generation Marine, had served in Afghanistan, and had survival training, was found dead in the Spokane river and they pulled his body out that day. He was said to be in great shape and was doing his usual run in Spokane, near the river. Authorities say he somehow must have fallen into the river and drowned and almost immediately said it was death by drowning. (UPDATE: Dr Marshall\u2019s wife (also a doctor and surgeon) has hired her own investigator and is questioning the quick call by Seattle PD. Again, more families are questioning these deaths and what some find absurd rulings by authorities.) Our own friend of ten long years, holistic doctor Rod Floyd, was found dead at his home here in Florida. He just miles from us and I\u2019d been to their home and they\u2019d been to mine. It was definitely not suicide in any way and his wife of 37 years says he was \u201chearty and healthy\u201d and calls it an accident. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll elaborate on right now, as even I don\u2019t know all the details. Dr Floyd did buy a sauna from me (but that wasn\u2019t involved in his death which I was told initially). Besides being a chiropractor, Dr Floyd was also a clinical professor at Palmer Chiropractor College near where we live. He and his wife have also run the Natural Awakenings magazine for some time. Our whole community is shocked and saddened by his death. Believe it or not just a few short weeks later, a holistic MD and his wife (a physician\u2019s assistant) were attacked, while on a relaxing beach stroll, by a sword wielding man in the same place- the tiny island of Grenada. The holistic MD survived. Sadly his wife was murdered and raped by the machete wielding attacker. Both perps in each attack of the doctors in Grenada in a couple of weeks are reported to have been recently released from prison and in both crimes (allegedly unrelated) the men just nonchalantly turned themselves in after the crime. Some experts have their theories on this. I won\u2019t elaborate at this time. Grenada locals are shocked and say they\u2019ve never seen anything like this- let alone twice in a row. The new spate of cancer researcher/doctors who are killed or found dead doesn\u2019t slow down and this might be the strangest of them all: Yet another cancer researcher, Professor Alan Clarke, 52, was found dead in the wood in hanging from a tree in a rubber body suit on December 28th, 2015 and they ruled it accidental. Just a week later, to the day, after losing our local friend and holistic doctor; Rod Floyd we lost another local friend also right here in our same local holistic community. The wonderful young Paige Adams FNP, B-C, also lived just up the road here locally in Florida was found dead at her home. She had worked closely for many years with her good friend and colleague Dr Bradstreet. The problem is Dr Bradstreet started off this whole holistic series when he was found dead in a river. Now we have his close friend (and our friend!) and his colleague of many years found dead. She was so young so this is particularly heartbreaking. Paige Adams had asked to stop by the house to see us days before she died. I feel awful for not taking her up on that, and my heart goes out to her family and patients. She is the only one in this entire series I\u2019ve ever written about who is not a doctor of some sort (DC, MD, DO, and even a PhD at the end) But she was a board certified Nurse Practitioner whose patients rave about her endlessly. She also stated publicly (which you\u2019ll see in the link) that if anything happened to her don\u2019t assume it was an accident. Cancer HIV Researcher in Seattle- Cheryl Deboer is found dead in a culvert with a plastic bag over her head. Investigators quickly state they can\u2019t see any evidence that it\u2019s a homicide, but her mother and other relatives state publicly there is no way she crawled 1.5 miles through brambles and water and mud to put a plastic bag over her head in a culvert. They stated that if she would have wanted to take her life (and listed plenty of reasons why she wouldn\u2019t with a happy family and job at the famous cancer research lab) she could have done it much more easily. The general public tends to agree with the family. Families are now starting to question these ridiculous statements called so quickly by local authorities. Some are hiring their own investigators and doubting local authorities. Many are wondering if the local authorities are to be trusted. Prev Next Yet another cancer researcher found dead in a field. He was only 34, and found in a safe quaint area in the countryside and people are astounded. Nearly immediately authorities announce his death is \u2018not suspicious\u2019, but there is a public outcry of how that could be so. We still have zero answers as to his cause of death. Wednesday, Triple homicide: Prominent Holistic doctor Henry Han, was found murdered on his 7 acre Santa Barbara estate, along with his wife and daughter, only 5 years of age. All were shot and wrapped in plastic. An arrest is quickly made of a young man who has no priors and lived with his father oceanside in Santa Barbara. His father was EX CIA. We will update as details emerge. Dr Harsch, 59, a self described holistic medicine MD was killed while riding his bicycle with a group of friends. He was the only one hit and none of the others were injured whatsoever. See details here.(Editor\u2019s note: We had another holistic doctor earlier in the series also killed on a bicycle ride last year and many of her friends and loved ones contacted me about their concerns and questions on her death). Dr Rose Polge, 25 apparently walked off her job where she worked at Torbay Hospital in Devon, and was missing for almost two months. She allegedly wrote a letter to the Health Secretary about her feelings on a political situation there with the doctors. Police later recovered her body from the sea more than 50 miles away from where a hoodie (believed to belong to her) was found. There is now an inquest into her death after post-mortem results proved inconclusive. A holistic doctor and well known professor, Dr Rasmussen, 76, in the Boston area, was found dead. She taught classes at a local University and discussed natural health, nutrition and biology, was found stabbed to death in her home. She was stabbed over 30 times and no arrests have been made at this time. Not to be confused with the case of Pennsylvania Osteopath Mary Bovier, also found stabbed to death in her home. No arrests have been made in either murder. One of the strangest cases yet is holistic MD and acupuncturist Dr Clogston, 68, who was missing 3 weeks and eventually found dead in his car which was allegedly found off the route some say he took to work for 30 years. The peculiar part is Dr Clogston went missing on March 14, was reported missing on March 15, but then seen by someone who \u201cknew him well\u201d according to local authorities (they say this on video on the news). So how then- was he found dead weeks later in his car? Many would like to know. This is one of the strangest to me out of around 40 mysterious deaths. Dr Suutari, an outspoken holistic doctor in the Los Angeles area, who had a beautiful family and new child, allegedly took his own life on Mother\u2019s day in the garage.Here are what details we know on this sad death. Prominent investigator hired by Dr Marshall\u2019s wife (She\u2019s also an MD and a surgeon) and investigator says on CBS news that the \u201caccidental death\u201d of Dr Marshall (that I reported on first in January) is most likely a professionally staged murder by someone in military or police. A must watch\u2026 An arrest was made in the death of holistic doctor Mary Louise Yoder. The curious part is that Dr. Yoder actually died in or around July 22nd 2015 (last year \u2013 a very busy week for holistic doctor deaths) and authorities almost immediately said she died of natural causes despite being fit, uber healthy and just 60 years old. I did not include her in the series originally since the authorities mistakenly said it was natural. So oftentimes we have authorities making these quick calls only to find out later they were completely false (why the rush officers?) So for months, Yoder\u2019s death was considered \u201cnatural\u201d until reports say a family member demanded an investigation. Now, this June, her employee (who was listed as her daughter on her obituary \u2013 they were so close) was arrested and it\u2019s said she poisoned her. The employee is only 23 years old and had said Yoder meant the world to her. Keep updated on this story as new details may emerge. A man stormed into a holistic doctor\u2019s office and gunned the man down and then turned the gun on himself \u2013 taking both their lives. A client walked in and saw them on the ground with a woman who worked there screaming. The very next day \u2013 see #34) another man went into another holistic doctor\u2019s office and killed him. These could be total coincidence, but we report all mysterious murders/suicides/unexplained sudden deaths of holistic doctors so are including them on this recap. Another man stormed into a holistic doctor\u2019s office (just a day later) and murdered the alternative MD in cold blood with a knife. The victim was Dr. Tiejun Huang Ph.D./MD R.Ac, RMT, DTCM. Dr Huang was a sports medicine specialist at the Beijing Olympic Games, a professor in sports medicine and rehabilitation and performs acupuncture and Chinese \u201cTuina\u201d massage. You can read all the details here. Dr Huang allegedly knew his assailant (authorities said immediately) but we had a holistic doctor gunned down by a man the day before in his office (see #33) who they say knew his assailant too. 2 holistic doctors in under 2 days murdered in their offices does raise eyebrows.

He added that Clinton was also given a pass by the Justice Department and the FBI for her private email server and mishandling of state secrets. \"She is so guilty in so many different ways that she shouldn't even be allowed to run for president,\" Trump stated. \"So right there, the system is really rigged.\" The Republican nominee added that he also isn't ruling out the possibility of widespread election fraud, with votes being miscounted at locations around the country. O'Reilly pointed out that there aren't any \"hard facts\" to back up such allegations. \"On a mass level ... 120 million American votes ... the thing's going to be dishonest? Do you believe that?\" O'Reilly asked. Trump asserted that there are 1.8 million deceased people registered to vote and 2.8 million people registered to vote in two states. \"There are things that are going on, Bill.\" Watch the \"O'Reilly Factor\" interview above, and let us know what you think in the comments.

{"label": "true", "text": "Oct 19, 2017 at 3:09 PM From Washington, D.C. to the NFL and Hollywood, America\u2019s idols are tumbling down. This is not a bad thing. For too long, we have wasted precious time and money worshipping these so-called \u201csocial justice\u201d warrior hypocrites who continue to disappoint. Here\u2019s to hoping all this disappointment will lead us back to what really matters, but don\u2019t count on it. Huge swaths of Americans still bow at the altar of social justice. They believe government-forced \u201ccharity\u201d will advance us to an utopian paradise where everyone enjoys the same outcome, despite personal effort, upbringing, unique abilities and education. Truth is, though, social justice is an oxymoron based on the false premise that the cure for injustice is leveling the playing field and redistributing wealth. As former Vice President Joe Biden once said, \u201cYou may call it redistribution of wealth \u00e2\u20ac\u2019 I just call it being fair.\u201d Karl Marx would be so proud. Marx hated religion, private property and Judeo-Christian values as much as leftists do today. That\u2019s why you should bolt out of any place of worship that combines Jesus, social justice and the government in the same sentence. In his book, \u201cThe Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism,\u201d economist Friedrich Hayek nails what\u2019s really at stake: \u201cThe aim of socialism is no less than to affect a complete redesigning of our traditional morals, law and language \u00e2\u20ac\u2019 and on this basis to stamp out the old order and the supposedly inexorable, unjustifiable conditions that prevent the institution of reason, fulfillment, true freedom and justice.\u201d Yesteryears\u2019 creepy social justice warriors are now out of the closet and no longer hide their agenda. Instead, they give it a pink boa and parade their intentions to destroy capitalism, silence free speech and scrub Judeo-Christian values from the public square. They harp about injustice and claim only they can fix it, which is one of the most arrogant, egotistical piles of hogwash you\u2019ll ever hear. All that, while they divide us into two groups, normal folks and them. They believe normal folks are about as smart as slugs, therefore incapable of coherent reasoning and self-care. To them, everyday Americans aren\u2019t diamonds in the rough, they are pliable, moldable objects used to reshape America into a socialist nightmare like Venezuela. As I\u2019ve said before, Democrats\u2019 sacrosanct belief that the government was created to control how fairness is spread around is nothing more than a modern-day effort to reinvent Robin Hood, without all the chivalry and green tights. Those who romantically embrace the concept of social justice believe the misnomer that stealing from some and passing it on to those who should have had it in the first place will result in some sort of righteous leveling. Leftists don\u2019t own the market on charity. Normal folks leave government out of the mix and combine their compassion with common sense. They bring food in one hand and a rifle in the other, knowing if they teach someone how to hunt, they\u2019ll eat for a lifetime. In comparison, leftists bring Trader Joe\u2019s bagels in one hand and a voter\u2019s registration card in the other. Seizing the opportunity to convert their victims into non-thinking entitlement aficionados, they stop at nothing to meet an immediate need, then lead them by their noses to leftist-run metropolises where crime and government handouts abound. I know, the devil is always in the details, but I\u2019ll go ahead and say it anyhow. Forced \u201ccharity\u201d doesn\u2019t bring about justice. Instead, it creates injustice when it stirs up animosity between the less fortunate and those being penalized, taxed, for their hard work under penalty of prosecution. In sharp contrast, there is a power in authentic generosity that no amount of government social-engineering could or will ever match. The social justice crowd should dust off the knees they protest with and try it sometime. ^ Susan Stamper Brown lives in Alaska and writes on culture, politics and current events."}

New reports claimed that there is a new woman involved in Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's alleged rocky relationship and it's none other than Jen's close friend, Chelsea Handler. Is the former \"Friends\" star jealous because her new husband and her pal are getting too close? Quite the opposite. A source claimed that Justin allegedly can't stand Chelsea and her antics. \"Recently, Justin came home to find Chelsea cooking breakfast in their kitchen ... completely naked,\" Celeb Dirty Laundry reported. \"Chelsea hates wearing clothes, and she documents her naked adventures on social media all the time.\" \"But Justin Theroux has forbidden her from having any more naked romps in his house while he is out of town,\" the report continued. According to an insider, Chelsea Handler was allegedly just trying to be funny. Unfortunately, Justin Theroux wasn't laughing. Apparently, Theroux confronted Aniston about her friend and how she irritates him. \"Chelsea thought it was hilarious, but Justin was really annoyed. Apparently Jen got in the habit of inviting Chelsea over for boozy girls' nights whenever he was away filming,\" OK! Magazine reported, as quoted by CDL. \"It bugged him to come home and find Chelsea there and the house a mess, but he bit his tongue. But now that he and Jen are married, he is establishing some ground rules, chief among them is that Chelsea is no longer welcome in their guest room,\" the report said. It has been previously reported that the newly weds are allegedly having problems over Jennifer Aniston being jealous because of Justin's purported closeness with his \"The Leftovers\" co-star, Margaret Qualley. The newlyweds' friends are hoping that the couple work out their differences especially since the couple is allegedly in the process of adopting a baby."}
{"label": "false", "text": "The hotel security guard wounded in the Las Vegas mass shooting has been arrested as an accomplice to that event. Fake news web sites capitalized on the tragedy of the 1 October 2017 mass shooting event in Las Vegas by proffering various unfounded conspiracy theories as \u201cnews,\u201d particularly those positing that a \u201csecond shooter\u201d took part in the carnage in additional to the one who rained bullets onto a concert crowd from a room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. In particular, fake news sites focused on Jesus Campos, the Mandalay Bay security guard who reportedly went to investigate a door alarm on the 32nd floor and was wounded in the leg when the shooter fired an estimated 200 bullets through his hotel room door. Those sites initially reported (without any evidence) that Campos was not an innocent victim wounded in the course of his duties, but was actually suspected of being an accomplice in the mass shooting. On 12 October 2017, an impostor CNN lookalike web site doubled down on that tidbit of fake news by posting an article holding that Campos (whose name was repeatedly misspelled as \u201cCompos\u201d) was not only suspected of being an accomplice to the shooting, but had actually been arrested on the grounds that he, too, shot at concert-goers from the Mandalay Bay\u2019s 32nd floor suite \u2014 and then shot the real perpetrator in the head (fatally) and himself in the arm (superficially) to provide cover for his actions: Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Compos has been arrested accused of being an accomplice and second shooter in the Las Vegas massacre that claimed the lives of 59 people and injured more than 500. Jesus Campos had originally been praised for his apparent heroics on October 1st, as he supposedly rushed to Paddock\u2019s suite, was shot in the upper thigh through the door, and continued to help get people to safety despite his wounds. However, FBI officials involved in the investigation now believe he was an accomplice of Paddock\u2019s, and was involved in the initial shooting as a second gunman from the other broken window in Paddock\u2019s 32nd-floor room. According to a senior FBI official, authorities became suspicions by the extreme amount of gunpowder residue found on Campos\u2019 hands and inconsistencies in his timeline of events. \u201cWe believe he killed [the shooter], shot holes through the door and his own arm to produce physical evidence for his cover story, then went and lay next to the elevator,\u201d the FBI official told CNN. Although some confusion remains, as of this writing, about the precise timing of when Campos was wounded relative to the onset of the larger mass shooting rampage, law enforcement has not at any time suggested that Campos was an accomplice to that mass shooting, much less taken him into custody on that basis.

Earlier this week, the Washington Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold uncovered yet another Donald Trump scam job, in which he used over $250,000 in charitable donations to help pay off his legal bills. And, because this is Trump, that sordid (and almost certainly illegal) bit of money laundering is just ONE despicable detail of the story. There are many more, including Trump\u2019s club trying to welch on a $1 million hole-in-one payout (out of all of Trump\u2019s bad qualities, his steadfast refusal to pay people what he owes them, while bragging about it, is the most enraging), along with the old bit about Trump blithely ignoring local ordinances so he could put a big, dipshit flagpole up at the Mar-A-Lago club, with his lawyers stating\u2014with a straight face\u2014that a smaller flag \u201cwould fail to appropriately express the magnitude of Donald J. Trump\u2019s . . . patriotism\u201d (NOTE: Until recently, Trump didn\u2019t know what the stripes on the flag symbolized). None of this is surprising, of course. Trump is a liar and a crook, and he commits abominable acts at such a frenetic pace that they get lost in the fury surrounding whatever horrible thing he does next. Keith Olbermann needed over 17 minutes on this site just to list a fraction of the atrocities Trump has staged during election season, and he\u2019s gonna need 17 more minutes to cover what happens between now and Election Day. Remember when Trump said he would get rid of food regulations? That was Thursday. Regardless, in the end, people are still gonna vote for this man. Maybe not enough to get him elected, but still: it\u2019ll be in the tens of millions. (Note to the people causing the polls to fluctuate: What the fuck is wrong with you? I gotta meet the five percent of people who saw Hillary come down with pneumonia and were like, \u201cForget her, gimme the dictator with dryer lint hair.\u201d) Nothing that Trump says, no damning piece of Trump reportage, and certainly no opinion piece like this one will stop his voters from pulling the lever. Nor will anything stop Trump from being the officious, braindead goon that he is. He will never answer for his crimes, and there\u2019s a frighteningly large portion of the electorate that will always love him for that. And so I\u2019d just like to say to that portion of the electorate: Fuck you. No, seriously. Go fuck yourselves. I\u2019m not gonna waste any more time trying to convince you that you\u2019re about to do something you\u2019ll regret forever. I\u2019m not gonna show you old clips of Trump saying rotten things. I\u2019m not gonna try to ANNIHILATE Trump by showing you records of his hypocrisy and greed. I\u2019m not gonna link to a John Oliver clip and be like, \u201cTHIS. So much this.\u201d Nothing\u2019s gonna take down Trump at this point, so I\u2019m not gonna bother. No no, this post is for ME. I am preaching to the sad little choir in my soul here. Because while Trump is a miserable bastard, YOU are the people who have handed him the bullhorn. YOU are the people willing to embarrass this nation and put it on the brink of economic ruin all because you wanna throw an electoral hissy fit. YOU are the people who want to revolutionize the way America does business by voting for its worst businessman, a disgusting neon pig who only makes money when he causes problems for other people instead of solving them. YOU are the thin-skinned yokels who clutch your bandoliers whenever someone hurls the mildest of slurs at you (\u201cdeplorables\u201d), while cheering Trump on as he leaves a bonfire of truly hateful invective everywhere he goes.

You guys don\u2019t give a shit about facts and research when it comes to Trump, so I\u2019m not gonna give a shit about whatever clumsy meme you cook up to explain why she did Benghazi. Nope. Sorry. Fuck your arguments, and fuck you. Trump has shown no respect for anyone, so I don\u2019t see why you deserve any either. Whatever mildly frustrating centrist liberal bureaucracy that Hillary presides over will be fine compared to the spray tan mushroom cloud that would arise all because YOU thought Trump was such a brave, un-PC dickhead to everyone within shouting distance. Trump is human waste. He is the worst of America stuffed into a nacho cheese casing, and he is emblematic of the kind of arrogant, flag-waving, trashy, racist moron that the rest of us have to DRAG kicking and screaming into the 21st century: Cliven Bundy, Sean Hannity, Kim Davis, and on and on and on. Trump voters are the people who have spent the past decade or so voting insipid obstructionists into office, sending death threats to anyone who even mentions the idea of gun control, demanding 100% tax cuts on millions of dollars they can only daydream about making, and getting suckered in by any Oil Party candidate waving a NO GAYS flag. Fuck them. These are needy hillbilly loons who are just as starved for attention as Trump himself. And voting for Trump is their way of emulating him, of saying FUCK YOU to everyone else as a mission statement, with no regard for the fallout. The old saw is that people get the politicians they deserve, and I\u2019ll be crestfallen if Trump wins and proves this to be true once more. If you vote for him, you\u2019re not making America great again. You are killing it. You are telling the world that America isn\u2019t worth it. You are telling the world that all of our big talk about freedom and unity and ideals is just a load of shit, and that you would prefer a smoldering dystopia where freedom is just a flimsy cover for evildoing, led by a man who believes that strength is measured only in killing people. You are handing the most important job on Earth to Napoleon from Animal Farm. And you are revealing your breathtaking ignorance to everyone except for yourself. I can\u2019t believe you can\u2019t see this. I want you to see this. I wanna shine a big fucking light in your face and scream at you that Trump isn\u2019t even qualified to be human, much less President. How are you gonna change the system if you elect some corrupt idiot who has no clue how to DO IT, huh? Can\u2019t you see this? Haven\u2019t you heard this asshole talk? THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? But I already know that\u2019s a futile effort. So fuck you, and fuck the GOP leaders who are too chickenshit to stand up to you. I\u2019m not gonna wish deportation or imprisonment or some kind of fantastical hyperbolic death upon you. I\u2019m not gonna ask for a wall to be built on the Mason-Dixon line. No no, I think you people deserve the EXACT same fate as Trump himself, and that is to lose, badly. That\u2019s what should happen to you.

The government program had been sharply curtailed by the Obama administration amid an outcry over police use of armored vehicles and other war-fighting gear to confront protesters.

Citing a source close to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, The Daily Beast claims that the Justice Department wants to know how those tasked with investigating Clinton's private email server went about their probe. DOJ officials are also reportedly interested in tallying the classified material contained in her emails and finding out \"who put that information into an unclassified environment,\" The Daily Beast says. Before Clinton was cleared of criminal wrongdoing by the FBI in July 2016, the former secretary of state claimed that many of the emails on her server were classified after the fact or that she was unaware of which \"headers\" denoted that an email was classified. Clinton's emails are a favorite grievance of President Trump, who has repeatedly called for his erstwhile political rival to be investigated again. As such, people within the DOJ are reportedly concerned that Trump's vocal tweets on the matter could cause the impression that the law enforcement agency is only doing the president's bidding. An unnamed former DOJ official even suggested to The Daily Beast that it was \"an open question\" if this inquiry would occur \"without a political directive from the White House.\" The Justice Department would not comment on the reported inquiry to The Daily Beast.

Goodell: \"were focusing on what we should be doing as the NFL,\" in response to more questions about Trump's Tweets Additionally, Goodell said he wants the league to \"stay out of politics\" and talked about how he hopes that there will eventually be \"zero\" players kneeling during the anthem. See original story below. As per usual, Donald Trump's using his personal Twitter account to spew garbage takes about shit he doesn't truly understand. Just a week after saying a one-game suspension would have scared Colin Kaepernick from kneeling in protest of the national anthem ever again (ROFL), he's back on Twitter clapping at the NFL for not bringing the hammer down on players who are still protesting. The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country! \"The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem,\" Trump tweeted. \"Total disrespect for our great country!\" This is no doubt in response to the NFL saying they would not prohibit players from protesting the anthem late last week. If Trump was so concerned about players protesting the national anthem\u2014which, again is a part of the First Amendment\u2014why doesn't he stop the police from murdering black people? You know, what these fucking protests are actually about. If Trump's so concerned about people openly resisting the tradition of bigging up America before playing a game, why doesn't he go to the root of the problem?

Sharpton claimed that after Usher\u2019s concert, she went back to her Days Inn hotel room and Usher called her, then went to Days Inn to sex her up like Color Me Badd (okay she didn\u2019t say the Color Me Badd part, but if the shoe fits\u2026).

WIFE/MANAGER: Sources close to the singer tell TMZ \u2026 he says there was never a hotel hookup with Quantasia Sharpton, telling friends, in November 2014 he was on the verge of getting engaged to Grace Miguel. Usher tells them at the time of his alleged encounter, Grace was his manager and they spent ALL their free time together. His people say when the two weren\u2019t enjoying free time, it was all business, and they were inseparable. The couple got engaged less than 2 months after the alleged Days Inn tryst.-via TMZ 2. ACCUSER\u2019S TIMELINE CONFLICT: Usher\u2019s people also say on the night in question his show ran late, which pushed the meet-and-greet well after midnight \u2026 and that flies in the face with Quantasia\u2019s timeline in which she claims she hooked up with the singer around 12. -via TMZ 3. TRAVEL SCHEDULE CONFLICT: We\u2019re told his travel schedule was super tight too \u2026 making it even more unlikely he even had time to step out for a secret trip to the Days Inn. -via TMZ Sometimes it\u2019s best to make moves in silence\u2026I wonder if Quantasia Sharpton and her attorney, Lisa Bloom, are now wishing that she did, because this is turning out to be a mess."}

{"label": "true", "text": "Here\u2019s one thing we can all say for certain regarding the latest twist of the Hillary Clinton email scandal: James Comey, who was once regarded as the Eliot Ness of law enforcement, a modern day straight-shooter impenetrable to political pressure, will instead leave the office of FBI chief as something closer to Inspector Clouseau. Don\u2019t take my word for it; that\u2019s the assessment of just about every law enforcement official, both former and present, I spoke to in the hours following his bizarre decision on Friday to reopen the case on the legality of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server, just days before the Nov 8 presidential election. It was bizarre, these people tell me, because the whole sordid Hillary Clinton email saga should never have gotten this far; Comey launched an investigation that developed far more evidence than anyone in law enforcement ever believed existed that Hillary Clinton broke the laws involving the receipt of sensitive government documents over an easily hacked private email server while she was President Obama\u2019s secretary of state. My sources in law enforcement were pretty convinced Comey would do the right thing and recommend charges to the Obama Justice Department, despite its political consequence, because the evidence was there and Comey was supposed to be so non political. He was a Republican appointed by Democrat Barack Obama to run a quasi independent investigative arm of the DOJ because he had a fierce independent streak. He famously brought white-collar cases during the pro-business Bush Administration as the US Attorney for the Southern District. Later in a senior position in the Bush DOJ, he refused to approve aspects of the government's domestic surveillance program. But there appears to be limits to Comey's independence, these same people now concede. In July, Comey came up with an odd excuse for not recommending criminal charges against Clinton: He couldn\u2019t develop enough evidence that Clinton intended to break the law under the standard of \u201cgross negligence.\u201d It was such an odd set rationale that Comey laid out for not bringing that case that most people listening to him at first thought he was laying out his reasoning to bring charges, as he explained one reckless move after another from Clinton in establishing the private server and private emails for handing all her government business. Indeed he initially laid out such a convincingly damning case against Clinton that markets began to crash for much of Comey\u2019s tortured remarks as investors initially came to the conclusion that Hillary Clinton would be indicted and someone as crazy as Donald Trump could become president. That didn\u2019t happen, of course, as Comey would explain -- and the markets that day recovered as he announced how Hillary Clinton may have done something criminal even if she never intended to do it and as a result he was giving her pass. Note to reader: Markets will take criminal over crazy any day of the week. But that wasn't the sentiment inside the FBI, where according to my law enforcement sources, a near mutiny broke out among career agents who believe there was plenty of evidence pointing to Clinton's gross negligence that Comey initially said never existed, and that their boss caved to political pressure from the Obama DOJ. Recall, Attorney General Loretta Lynch just had a private meeting with former president and possible first husband Bill Clinton just days before Comey handed in his verdict, which added to the fetid smell of the FBI chief's decision. Then there was the evidence: Remember, Clinton has never given much of a rationale for using only a private email account via her own server to send and receive state department related emails other than its convenience, which should never outweigh national security. Meanwhile, career agents argued her intent was inherent in simple creation of the private email server and exclusive use of a private email is supposed to be verboten under various laws including the Espionage Act. Her supporters point out that others like Bush Administration Secretary of State Colin Powell used a private email account, but that omits the fact that Powell\u2019s email was from a computer he kept at the state department and he used it before the document laws were beefed up post 9-11. He also didn\u2019t go through the process of creating his own easily hacked private server. Another difference: Clinton used her private account exclusively, and Powell didn\u2019t. That\u2019s probably because Powell didn\u2019t have a reason to have a private server that he could control and erase its contents; He didn\u2019t have a private charity that would do business with the federal government and would become a private enrichment vehicle, as Hillary and her former-president husband Bill have in the form of the Clinton Foundation. Now we have Comey possibly looking to make amends with his troops, possibly looking to cover his rear end, definitely looking incompetent, because of all people Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former Congressman, and soon-to-be ex husband of Hillary Clinton confident, Huma Abedin. FBI agents, investigating Weiner\u2019s alleged depravity with an underage girl, stumbled across some more Hillary-related emails from Abedin, and as we learned Friday an investigation that was \"closed\" is now suddenly open. I say closed in quotes to underscore the murkiness of FBI investigative procedures. Cases are rarely officially closed and even when they are the bureau will leave the door open that additional information would re-ignite their efforts. If you think this story could get any more surreal consider the following: law enforcement sources tell Fox Business that Weiner could soon cooperate with the Feds, and that can\u2019t be good news for his wife or her boss. (an attorney for Anthony Weiner tells Fox News there is no cooperation agreement in place) Weiner, I am told, was miffed at the Clinton\u2019s for keeping him away from the campaign before his latest sexting episode. Now facing a possible prison term for alleged dealings with an underage girl he has even more incentive to cooperate against his soon-to-be ex-wife and the Clintons. I can't tell you whether the new emails will reach Comey's standard for gross negligence, but that's really besides the point. The country could have been spared this spectacle if he had just done the right thing in July and recommended a charge against Clinton. Then the Democrats could have regrouped and given the nomination to Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden or someone who doesn't stand a chance of being indicted or impeached if elected. Yes if Hillary Clinton manages to win, she will be a sitting duck for every GOP investigative committee, particularly as the odds grow the Republicans will now keep the House and possibly the Senate. If you thought the last eight years were contentious, you ain't seen nothing yet. Thank you, James Comey."}

{"label": "false", "text": "\"Day One\" is a multi-part series in which CBS News' Margaret Brennan speaks with former U.S. government officials on the major foreign policy issues the next president will inherit on the first day of their presidency. The next president will face countless challenges on day one. Among the biggest is the ongoing civil war in Syria. Margaret Brennan spoke with Leon Panetta -- a former CIA director, defense secretary, and White House chief of staff -- about the road ahead for U.S. involvement in the war-torn nation. LEON PANETTA: Inaction is not an option in Syria because if you stand back, the situation is gonna get worse. Look, the best-case scenario would be to have Assad step down, to have a transitional government be able to establish itself representing each of the factions that are there -- the Sunnis, the Kurds, the Shias. And then, frankly, have the Russians and whatever is left of the Syrian forces join with the United States in going after ISIS to truly defeat them. That would be the best-case scenario. MARGARET BRENNAN: What are the odds of that? PANETTA: Not very good. Not very good. BRENNAN: What's the worst-case scenario? PANETTA: The worst-case scenario is that Assad continues to remain in power, continues to kill Syrians. That refugees continue to flow out of Syria, that the Russians continue to have a presence there and continue to attack our moderate forces that we're trying to train in Syria. And that ISIS then uses that and creates an even bigger base from which to conduct attacks against this country. That's the worst-case scenario. BRENNAN: Sounds like you're describing what's happening now. PANETTA: It is what's happening now. And it's what can continue to happen in the future if we don't deal with it. BRENNAN: There are around 300 special operators in Syria right now. Will the next president have to commit more American boots on the ground? PANETTA: I think the likelihood is that the next president is gonna have to consider adding additional special forces on the ground to try to assist those moderate forces that are taking on ISIS, and that are taking on Assad's forces. And we have to increase our air strikes. We've got to do all of those things in order to put increasing pressure on ISIS but also on Assad. We can't surrender one objective for the other. We've gotta continue to press on both fronts. BRENNAN: Is it possible to defeat ISIS without challenging Assad? PANETTA: I think it's very difficult as we've seen to conduct effective operations against ISIS when we're dealing with Assad's forces pressing us in different places. And when we're dealing with the Russians who go in and literally bomb the very forces that we're training to go after Assad and to go after ISIS. We cannot have that situation continue in the future. Protect our forces there. BRENNAN: So the U.S. has to confront Russia? PANETTA: We are hoping upon hope that the Russians will do the right thing. They're not gonna do the right thing without pressure. They're not gonna do the right thing without giving our diplomats greater leverage than what they have now to deal with the Russians. To do that we have got to make very clear that we have objectives to achieve, that we intend to press to achieve those objectives, and that we will not allow them to divert us from the goals of defending ourselves.

{"label": "true", "text": "South Park is one of television's longest-running shows, a 20-seasons-and-counting award-winning cultural behemoth that has spawned movies, imitations, and countless time-wasting memes. But could the show be, at least in part, responsible for one of the scariest political movements of the present moment? Lindsey Weedston thinks so. Weedston, a 29-year-old writer from Bothell, Washington, penned an article for The Establishment recently which argued that the show helped lead to the rise of the alt-right. The piece, \" How 'South Park' Helped Empower the Alt-Right,\" grabbed my attention enough that I decided to call her up and see why exactly she thought Kyle, Cartman, and crew led us to Richard Spencer, 4Chan, and Charlottesville. Our conversation, edited lightly for length and clarity, is below. To start off, how does South Park treat what some people might think of as \"PC culture\"? I read a post that explained this really well\u2014South Park\u2019s highest moral goal is to not care. It treats PC culture as [if] the opposite of PC culture is not to care about anything. So caring about an issue is basically stupid, and pretty much every episode goes back to: it doesn\u2019t matter, being PC is uncool, and not giving a fuck about anything is the way you should feel. In your article you trace a history of that attitude, starting with the misinterpretation of a character in an Oliver Stone movie. Can you take me through that? That was interesting. So [the 1987 movie] Wall Street, I didn\u2019t know before I researched for the article that Oliver Stone actually meant it the opposite of how so many people took it. Wall Street was supposed to be an indictment of Wall Street and the type of person that thinks greed is good. It was very interesting to find that so many people actually went with the mantra \"greed is good,\" and it seems like that has shaped a lot of our culture. Now we have prosperity Christianity\u2014actually telling people that God wants them to collect as much wealth as possible. It\u2019s not just Wall Street. For a long time, our capitalist society has led up to this idea that the ultimate goal is to collect as much wealth as possible. That movie accelerated the idea of collecting all the wealth and power you can. And then you talk about shock jock\u2019s of the \u201980s and \u201990s, the Howard Sterns of the world. What does that have to do with the South Park-popularized attitude of caring being uncool? The original title of this article I pitched was actually \"The History of Celebrated Assholes.\" My first draft of the piece, I ended up researching early forms of shock and asshole comedy. I found out the person considered the first shock jock was actually a black man, Petey Greene. Howard Stern was influenced by him. It\u2019s really interesting to learn the kind of things he talked about. He was appealing because he was very down to Earth, and he spoke to the black community in a very straightforward way that no white disk jockey had ever before. When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, he went on air and started speaking to the community, and is credited with calming the situation down. You can go on YouTube and find some of the shows and listen to the way he speaks. It\u2019s very colloquial. He just acts like a normal person. I think white people at the time looked at that as being shocking, and that\u2019s why he was labeled as a shock jock. He was really active in the community. He promoted education and feeding the hungry. He wasn\u2019t an asshole, but history is very interesting. In my original draft, I wrote about how he influenced Howard Stern. Howard Stern was actually invited onto his show. Stern went on in black face and used the n word, and Greene thought it was funny. Greene died fairly young, so then you move onto Howard Stern\u2019s career. Howard Stern, I\u2019m sure, has done some good stuff in his life. But he is very much associated with the shock jock label, and a lot of what he does is just to rile people up. I think it\u2019s interesting how you have that transition from somebody who was just being real and communicating to his people in a way that made sense to him; and then you have Howard Stern, who makes a lot of money\u2014and in fact an entire career\u2014from pissing people off. How do you get to the alt-right from that? How does South Park's overall attitude connect to the alt-right? I believe that South Park's anti-PC messages paved the way for white supremacist groups to recruit much of the largely white male fanbase into what is now referred to as the alt-right, or other groups that are identical in all but name. Matt and Trey promoted this idea that you should be able to say or animate anything you want in the name of satire and humor, and any harm that it caused either didn't exist or didn't matter. When they experienced backlash for their intensifying mockery of already-vulnerable groups and their attitude of, \"Repeating horrible things said by bigots up to and including Nazis is funny because it upsets people,\" they reacted by depicting their critics as free-speech-oppressing caricatures like the \" PC bro.\" They promoted the idea that marginalized people\u2014trans people, people of color, Jewish people, etc.\u2014speaking out against harm caused by South Park's brand of \"humor\" and [the show's] \"I do what I want\" attitude are the real oppressors. White supremacist groups and their better-at-PR counterpart the \"alt-right\" use this message constantly to recruit young white men and boys. They tell these kids that they're the ones being oppressed by those telling them that they have privilege, and therefore need to make some effort to at least not use certain words and maybe examine prejudiced attitudes they might have picked up from a culture that is prejudiced in many ways. The alt-right promotes the idea of white male victimization, drawing in youth that has been told by South Park that the plight of marginalized groups doesn't matter and that \"political correctness\" is oppressing them. Once those groups have their loyalty, they can then indoctrinate these young guys into straight up white supremacist ideas under the guise that \"the PC police don't want you to think about this.\" I don't think Matt and Trey meant to create an army for the alt-right, but they seem to be leaning into it rather than admitting that they might have messed up. Cartman plays a big part in your article. He\u2019s often not the hero in the storylines of the individual episodes, but he is a fan favorite. Can you break down why that\u2019s a problem? Cartman is a perfect representation of satire gone wrong. Just like with Wall Street, the people who view your content take the literal meaning of something instead of taking it as the indictment that it is. It\u2019s pretty clear, especially in the earlier episodes, that you\u2019re not supposed to like Cartman. You aren\u2019t supposed to identify with him. You\u2019re supposed to hate him, or at least understand he is the opposite of the ideal of a human being. That is supposed to be represented in his bigotry, his ignorance, and his appearance as well, with him being fat. And yet he is a fan favorite, and people do identify with him. I think it was Matt Stone who said he identifies with Cartman more than any of the other characters. I think their original intention was to say, okay, don\u2019t be like Cartman. But instead, you have the opposite reaction of people idealizing his attitude and his selfishness and his desire to make people suffer and his bigotry. He has become a representation of how the fans feel that you should be. Can you talk about \" South Park Republicans\"\u2014South Park being adopted by right wingers? That plays into what I think is the logical conclusion of the anti-PC movement. Like I said in the article, there has been a rebellion against this idea of being PC. Political correctness has evolved into a derogatory term meaning, you are being sensitive to someone. It has become this big boogeyman. There is an idea that there is this social justice warrior, PC police entity who will come and yell at you and punish you if you say what you are actually thinking. So there has been a rebellion against this strawman. It has come down to, if you care about anyone at all, if you want to be sensitive to anyone\u2019s needs, then you\u2019re this politically correct nerd or you\u2019re a nun with a ruler or an authority figure telling people what to do. You are therefore uncool and the enemy. It\u2019s very reactionary. But it\u2019s so popular and so widespread on the right now, and you actually have people coming out with articles and people in the White House using that rhetoric to help further their political careers. So it\u2019s really not surprising to me that there articles out there saying South Park is right on actual political issues. What has followed South Park\u2019s wake? The first example that comes to mind is a lot of the cultural treatment of trans people. South Park has had some really transphobic content. Even before the Caitlyn Jenner episode, there was the whole treatment of Mr. Garrison and his sex change. I remember the episode where they included footage of an actual gender affirmation surgery, just saying, \"look how gross this is.\" They had a caption like, \"This is footage of the actual surgery,\" as though it\u2019s supposed to be horrible and sad because it\u2019s gross. But any surgery looks gross and disgusting. Their definite goal was to be like, this is gross and this is wrong. You see a huge amount of transphobia from a lot of alt-right groups. You have these bathroom bills that are trying to keep trans people out of public restrooms, which is basically keeping them out of public life. It\u2019s trying to keep them from having access to any kind of normal life. The sudden emergence of the bathroom bills surprised me, but maybe it shouldn\u2019t have. It seemed to come out of nowhere, but then you look at the timing and it does kind of follow Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s coming out to the public as a woman. That in itself probably would have gotten some backlash, but then you look at how popular South Park is, and there\u2019s no way it didn\u2019t play a role in people reacting the way they did: reacting like, oh that\u2019s just so gross\u2014their existence is gross and wrong. You end your essay with a call for what you call radical kindness. What does that mean? Radical kindness comes from being around young people, specifically in communities that are more social justice-oriented. In my community, I\u2019m seeing a shift towards memes being positive and used to uplift people. I think people are just tired of beating on each other and attacking each other, and the younger generations especially are starting to rebel against that. I feel like a lot of what my generation, millennials, has put out there has been negative. We\u2019re kind of a depressed generation, so I think younger people are reacting to that and deciding, let\u2019s be nice to each other. In a society where being mean to each other is the norm, kindness is punk. That\u2019s rebelling. That\u2019s what\u2019s cool."}
{"label": "true", "text": "There was a break-in at Stephen Paddock\u2019s Reno home on Sunday. Local police say they were called to the home by a neighbor who says they saw the lights on. RT reported: Reno police officer Tim Broadway told The Associated Press, \u201cNobody really saw anything, just a light was on with nobody in the residence.\u201d Broadway said officers discovered that \u201csomeone had broken into the house\u201d and he immediately contacted the FBI. He added that the suspects broke into the home through the front door over the weekend, but said he was not sure exactly how they gained entry. Police are not aware of any damages or anything that was stolen. There are no suspects at this time or any descriptions of a suspect. According to KOLOtv investigators searched Paddock\u2019s Reno home on October 3rd and found firearms. At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Investigators said they found five handguns, two shotguns and a \u201cplethora of ammunition\u201d and electronics. The house is being treated as a potential crime scene. At least some of the guns found on Paddock\u2019s properties had been bought at the Cabela\u2019s store in Verdi. We can\u2019t even trust the FBI at this point so who knows what really happened with this \u2018break-in\u2019. The current Head of the FBI in Las Vegas was appointed by former FBI Head and now admitted leaker James Comey. Is this why the investigation is such a mess? The investigation into the events and the motive behind the Las Vegas shooting last Sunday night is in flux. To date no motive is provided by the FBI and local police. Last week a press conference was held jointly by the FBI and the local Sheriff in Las Vegas concerning the recent murder of at least 59 people in that city. The Sheriff appeared transparent in the information he supplied. But the major question that everyone wanted to know was \u2013 why did the killer do it? What was his motive? Monday we found out that the killer shot the security guardbefore he fired on the crowd of people. This directly contradicts with the earlier report that the security guard found the room of the killer and stopped him from shooting on the crowd. As a result many more questions are raised like \u2013 Why the change in story? Why did the killer ever stop shooting on the crowd if the security guard did not stop him? The FBI\u2019s lack of transparency along with the corrupt and criminal acts by former FBI Directors lead all of America to begin forming conspiracy theories and to further lose trust in the FBI. In a significant timeline change, Sheriff Lombardo reveals Mandalay Bay security guard, Jesus Campos, was shot BEFORE the Las Vegas attack started. \u201cLas Vegas sheriff says Mandalay Bay security guard was shot 6 minutes before first shots were fired at crowd.,\u201d reports ABC News. https://twitter.com/ABC/status/917516195342905344?ref_src=twsrc% 5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http% 3A% 2F% 2Fwww.thegatewaypundit.com% 2F2017% 2F10% 2Fsignificant-timeline-change-sheriff-reveals-mandalay-bay-security-guard-shot-vegas-attack% 2F https://twitter.com/mattdpearce/status/917513534342172672?ref_src=twsrc% 5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http% 3A% 2F% 2Fwww.thegatewaypundit.com% 2F2017% 2F10% 2Fsignificant-timeline-change-sheriff-reveals-mandalay-bay-security-guard-shot-vegas-attack% 2F https://twitter.com/mattdpearce/status/917513740995649537?ref_src=twsrc% 5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http% 3A% 2F% 2Fwww.thegatewaypundit.com% 2F2017% 2F10% 2Fsignificant-timeline-change-sheriff-reveals-mandalay-bay-security-guard-shot-vegas-attack% 2F Jesus Campos, the security guard has been \u201chailed as a hero after risking his life seeking out Stephen Paddock\u2019s sniper\u2019s nest,\u201d according to Newsmax. Newsmax reports: Paddock shot the unarmed Campos in the leg as he was moving toward the room outside in the hallway, The Daily Beast reported being told by Dave Hickey, president of the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America. Campos had taken an elevator to the 32nd floor of the hotel because the stairway door had been blocked, The Daily Beast said, and when Campos got to the door where he suspected Paddock was barricaded, he was met with gunfire through the door. The wounded Campos then radioed casino dispatch informing them of his and Paddock\u2019s location in the hotel. Police said the suspect fired some 200 rounds at them as they approached the room, The Daily Beast noted. In another wild turn, Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino worker says he dodged bullets before Paddock shot at the Las Vegas concert crowd. A hotel engineer at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino says he radioed for help as soon as gunman Stephen Paddock started shooting at him and a security guard. \u201cI could feel them (bullets) pass right behind my head,\u201d engineer Stephen Schuck told NBC News\u2019 \u201cToday\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cSomething hit me in the back.\u201d Schuck was on a higher level of the Las Vegas hotel on Oct. 1 when he got a call to look at a fire exit door that wouldn\u2019t open on the 32nd floor.

{"label": "true", "text": "The world Is watching and so is oil as the death toll rises in the streets of Iran, where the people revolt against a terrible economy and the lack of any real freedoms and rights. At least 19 people were reported killed in street protests in Iran, while President Hassan Rouhani on one hand defended their right to protest but on the other hand warned he would show \u201cno tolerance\u201d for those who incite unrest. Many arrests have been made and the government of Iran says it may seek the death penalty, for what they say are crimes against God, in demonstrations that have gone on for over 5 days in a row. President Trump tweeted that \u201dIran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food &amp; for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!\u201d The uprising in IRAN is just another risk factor in a global oil market that is tightening. Strong global demand and shale oil production that is falling far short of what the Energy Information keeps telling us it is. Reports from the Texas Railroad Commission is telling us that Texas shale oil production has been stagnant and not rising as the production decline rate year over year is taking its toll. Total oil stocks are down a whopping 135M barrels just since April even as U.S. oil production is supposedly at a record high. Bad data is becoming a bigger risk as underinvestment has led to the least amount of oil discoveries in 70 years and the global oil replenishment rate ratio fell to 11 percent this year, down from more than 50 percent in 2012 according to a new report. That is a dangerous situation, especially because of the over estimates of shale oil output. ETF reports that this has led to the lowest ever volumes of oil discoveries in 2017, Rystad Energy said last week. While the low-level of discoveries is not an immediate threat to global oil supply, it could become a threat ten years down the road, according to Rystad Energy. In ten years\u2019 time, U.S. shale production may peak, at least according to OPEC that sees shale peaking after 2025, although the cartel has conceded that U.S. tight oil has defied previous forecasts and has increased production more than initially expected and will continue to do so in the short-term. This year has seen less than 7 billion barrels of oil equivalent discovered globally, a volume as low as last seen in the 1940s, Rystad Energy has estimated. What worries analysts the most is the fact that this year the reserve replacement ratio\u2013the amount of discovered resources relative to the amount of production\u2013was a mere 11 percent, compared to 50 percent in 2012, Sonia Mlad\u00e1 Passos, Senior Analyst at Rystad Energy, said. The other ongoing risk is Venezuela. An explosion over the weekend that hit Venezuela\u2019s largest refinery was an accident waiting to happen. Deferred maintenance and bad management as the Venezuelan government stole money and failed to do even the most basic maintenance for the facility according to sources. Reuters reported that a former oil minister excoriated Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a newspaper column on Sunday, accusing the leftist leader of behaving like biblical King Herod and plunging the oil-rich nation into economic devastation. Rafael Ramirez, who was the all-powerful head of the oil ministry and state energy company PDVSA for a decade, has long been a rival of Maduro. In recent months, Ramirez has grown increasingly critical of Maduro\u2019s handling of a fourth straight year of recession that has triggered malnutrition, widespread food and medicine shortages, the world\u2019s steepest inflation, and a surge in emigration. A furious Maduro ordered Ramirez to resign as the nation\u2019s United Nations ambassador in New York last month after an article entitled the \u201cThe Storm\u201d was perceived as an attack on his government. We haven\u2019t even got to the cold. Wicked winter weather is causing a surge in oil and natural gas and coal demand. Demand for coal burns hit three-year high causing to temporarily put it above natural gas as the top s U.S. power sources. There are reports that they were shortages of natural gas in Northern Alberta county under state of emergency due to natural gas disruption. The report said that large parts of northern Alberta was under a state of emergency over the weekend due to low natural gas pressure and system outages. The Energy Report has kept our bullish outlook and we still believe that the double bottom at $26 a barrel was a generational low. Despite all the bearish hype that the market had last year and bad info this year oil looks poised for a big move. Make sure you are hedged!

{"label": "true", "text": "Trump Jr. allowed Tuesday night in an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel that \"he has probably met with other people from Russia\" but insisted that he did not attempt to coordinate to impact the election or try to damage Hillary Clinton. He repeatedly suggested that the charges of collusion were \"ridiculous\" and \"overplayed\" and insisted that his father knew nothing about the June 2016 meeting. \"It was such a nothing there was nothing to tell\" his father, said Trump Jr. Donald Trump Jr. eagerly accepted help from what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid his father's campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton, according to the emails. The email exchange posted to Twitter by President Donald Trump's eldest son shows him conversing with a music publicist who wanted him to meet with a lawyer from Moscow. The publicist describes the lawyer as a \"Russian government attorney\" who has dirt on Clinton as \"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\" In one response, Trump Jr. says he would \"love\" to hear more. President Donald Trump says his eldest son is \"a high-quality person,\" and he applauds \"his transparency.\" In a tweet Tuesday night, the president promoted his son's appearance on Fox News and called him a \"great person who loves our country.\" My son, Donald, will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10:00 P.M. He is a great person who loves our country! White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read a brief statement from the president Tuesday in response to revelations that Trump Jr. agreed to hear damaging information on Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government's effort to help his father. Trump Jr., who was deeply involved in his father's presidential campaign, released the emails along with a statement describing the disclosure as an effort \"to be totally transparent.\" The emails with publicist Rob Goldstone show that Trump Jr. was told that the Russian government had information that could \"incriminate\" Clinton and her dealings with Russia. Here's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQ The messages were the latest disclosure to roil the ongoing investigation into potential coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said sought to influence the outcome of the election in Trump's favor. As congressional committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, investigate, the emails will almost certainly be reviewed for any signs of potential campaign collusion with the Kremlin, which the White House has repeatedly denied. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment on the emails, citing the ongoing investigation. Here is page 4 (which did not post due to space constraints). pic.twitter.com/z1Xi4nr2gq In the emails, Goldstone wrote to Trump Jr. that the information \"would be very useful to your father.\" Goldstone was working to connect Trump Jr. to Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, who later met with Trump Jr. in New York at Trump Tower. Veselnitskaya has denied that she ever worked for the Russian government and said on Tuesday that she doesn't represent the Russian government, only herself. She also said she \"couldn't have had\" information on Hillary Clinton. \"If it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer,\" Trump Jr. replied to Goldstone in one of a series of email exchanges the younger Trump posted to Twitter. The emails, dated early June, show Goldstone telling Trump that singer Emin Agalarov and his father, Moscow-based developer Aras Agalarov, had \"helped along\" the Russian government's support for Trump. The elder Agalarov was involved with Trump in hosting the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. The two men also had preliminary discussions about building a Trump Tower in Moscow that fell through. Trump also appeared in a music video with the younger Agalarov. Goldstone at one point said he could send the information to Trump's father first directly \"via Rhona,\" an apparent reference to the elder Trump's longtime assistant Rhona Graff. The email release followed days of evolving accounts from Trump Jr. about the nature of the meeting and its purpose. The president's son posted the emails only after they were obtained by The New York Times. On Saturday, Trump Jr. described the encounter as being a \"short introductory meeting\" focused on the disbanded program that had allowed American adoptions of Russian children. Moscow ended the adoptions in response to Magnitsky Act sanctions created in response to alleged human rights violations in Russia. A day later, Trump Jr. changed his account, acknowledging that he was told beforehand that Veselnitskaya might have information \"helpful\" to the Trump campaign, and was told by her during the meeting that she had something about Clinton. In his third description of what occurred, on Tuesday, Trump Jr. said he had believed the information he would hear about Clinton would be political opposition research. He said that he first wanted to speak by phone, but that when that didn't work out, he was told that the attorney would be in New York \"and I decided to take the meeting.\" \"The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official,\" Trump Jr. said in the Tuesday statement. \"And, as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act.\" The Trump Organization has confirmed the authenticity of Trump Jr. posts on Twitter releasing the email chain. Associated Press writers Nekesa Mumbi Moody in New York and Julie Bykowicz in Washington contributed to this report."}
{"label": "false", "text": "Earlier this year, two hunters suffered gun-related injuries while camped out at the Circle Dug Ranch, a Texas ranch near the U.S.-Mexico border. According to Texas Monthly, a 26-year-old hunting guide named Walker Daugherty was shot in the abdomen. One of his clients, 59-year-old Edwin Roberts, was shot in the arm. When Daugherty reported the incident to law enforcement officials, he and his fianc\u00e9e claimed that the gunfire came from illegal Mexican immigrants who were attempting to steal the Daugherty\u2019s RV and kidnap their clients. After the incident, a GoFundMe page was launched to help Daugherty pay for his medical expenses. According to KOSA CBS 7, the now-inactive campaign page stated that Daugherty was shot by illegal immigrants who were trying to steal his RV. More than $25,000 was raised to cover Daugherty\u2019s medical expenses. Upon hearing the story, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller posted a message to Facebook calling Daugherty a hero and pledging his support for a border wall. \u201cThis is why we need the wall and to secure our borders,\u201d wrote Miller. According to the Dallas News, the post was shared 6,500 times before Miller deleted it. Weeks later, law enforcement officials determined Daugherty\u2019s story was false. According to KOSA CBS 7 in Texas, an investigation by the Presidio County Sheriff\u2019s Department found that the gunfire did not come from immigrants crossing the border \u2014 it came from the hunters themselves. That\u2019s right: friendly fire. Investigators determined that Daugherty shot Roberts and that another hunting guide, Michael Bryant, shot Daugherty. The Daugherty family reportedly released a statement about the Presidio County Sheriff\u2019s investigation that was published on the blog The Westerner. \u201cWe do not deny that our hunter client was hit by a bullet that resulted from a horribly fearful and confusing situation. However, the bullet that shot our son was not. That shot came later and from an entirely different direction. We are unable to reveal all the details of the event at this time but we do not agree with the Sherriff\u2019s stated conclusion to the incident.\u201d Read their full statement here. Daugherty and Bryant have since been indicted on charges of deadly conduct by discharging firearms in the direction of others, reports the Austin American-Statesman."}
{"label": "false", "text": "BERKELEY, Calif. (KCRA) \u2014 Several fights broke out during largely-peaceful protests in Berkeley Sunday afternoon when about 4,000 people converged on the city, police said. Thirteen people who ranged in ages from 20 to 47 years old, were arrested for \"various violations\u201d including assault with a deadly weapon and felony assault during the events, Berkeley police said. Of the people arrested during the protests, several were wearing masks while others were connected to assaults. Two men were arrested after exchanging blows. The SFGate reported they were quickly swept up by officers inside Civic Center Park. Police detained Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson at the protests. The SFGate reported he was handcuffed after being chased by a mob of demonstrators who took swings at him and pepper sprayed him. Police said Gibson was actually \"rescued\" and was not arrested or charged. The crowd began to diminish around 3:30 p.m., six hours after a march led to the protests. The event was one of several rallies that had been called for Sunday in Berkeley, a day after a controversial freedom rally planned by Gibson in San Francisco fizzled amid throngs of counterprotesters. Hundreds of people gathered on the UC Berkeley campus around 10 a.m. Sunday. They then marched to Civic Center Park, where police had set up barricades and secured the area with bomb sniffing dogs. The march was part of the Bay Area Rally Against Hate Rally. In a statement early Sunday, the group said \"we fully intend to move forward with (the Rally Against Hate)\" on the campus despite calls by the university police department for people to stay away for safety reasons. The rally was held in response to the planned right-wing protest \"No To Marxism in America.\" However, organizer Amber Cummings canceled the protest on Friday, saying Berkeley officials and left-wing extremists made it impossible to hold the event and she would be the sole attendee. Despite the cancellation, hundreds of ring-wing protesters showed up to the park. Around 1 p.m., police reported the crowd had grown to several thousand. A skirmish broke out between several dozen left-wing demonstrators and a handful of right-wing supporters. The skirmish was tense but ended quickly. The left-wing protesters surrounded the small number of right-wing supporters, then shouted at them and pushed them. The right-wing protesters sought protection from police and were escorted away. Before the unpermitted events, Berkeley police put into place several rules in response the protests, stating, \"To ensure the peaceful expression of free speech, the City of Berkeley will be prohibiting sticks, pipes, poles and anything else that can be used for a 'riot' at Civic Center Park.\" Other banned items include explosives, pepper spray, axes, dogs (except for service animals), eggs, torches and more. Police also said anything that \"covers or partially covers the face and shields the wearer's face from view, or partially from view, is prohibited.\" However, protesters with an anarchist group arrived at the park wearing masks and hoods that covered their faces. The group of more than 100 hooded protesters, with shields emblazoned with the words \"no hate\" and waving a flag identifying themselves as anarchist, broke through police lines, avoiding security checks by officers to take away possible weapons. Then the group blended in with the rest of the crowd. The group pushed their way past police barricades and into Civic Center Park. They assaulted at least five people by punching and kicking them. Gibson was one of the people assaulted by the group. Police broke up the fights, using what appeared to be a smoke grenade to stop one scuffle. The three people who were attacked ran behind police lines to escape. Then around 2:30 p.m., more than 1,000 people left the park and began marching north Martin Luther King Way. An hour later, the crowd had diminished and many roads reopened. ---- The Associated Press contributed to this story."}

Paddock added that: He was just a guy. Something happened, he snapped or something. Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo also told FOX News that a motive is not known, explaining: We have no idea what his belief system was. Right now, we believe he was the sole aggressor and the scene is static. Unfortunately, ISIS accounts online are claiming Stephen C. Paddock actually converted to Islam months ago and the shooting was on their behalf. It is unclear if this is coming from actual ISIS propaganda accounts or random supporters, though Good Morning America has begun discussing the possibilities of this as well. The Associated Press has posted the above tweet, announcing this news. Brother Eric Paddock tells Daily Mail that their family is confused and shocked. He explained: We know absolutely nothing, this is just, we are dumbfounded \u2026 We have absolutely no idea. Our condolences go to the victims and all their families. The Orlando Sentinel reports that, according to public records, much of Stephen C. Paddock\u2019s family resides in Florida. Eric Paddock says that his 90-year-old mother, who lives close to him, is struggling to cope with the news and is \u201cin shock\u201d. Paddock told Daily Mail: Our family is OK, we\u2019re sitting in here in our house hoping that everyone doesn\u2019t attack us. My mother is 90 years old, lives down the street from me, we\u2019re just completely dumbfounded.

Eric Paddock said that he and his brother lived on different coasts and that they did not speak very often. Eric Paddock said his brother was a regular at Las Vegas casinos, according to Good Morning America, and Stephen used to work as an accountant. In an interview with Las Vegas Review Journal, Paddock also said: We have no idea how this happened. It\u2019s like an asteroid just fell on top of our family. He then added: There is no reason we can imagine why Stephen would do something like this. All we can do is send our condolences to the people who died. Just no reason, no warning \u2026 As far as we knew, he had enough money to live the rest of his life in comfort. Paddock said that, as much as he knew, his brother had no known health or financial problems at the time of the shooting. With over 50 people dead and over 400 injured in the shooting, this is reported to be the deadliest shooting in American history.

{"label": "true", "text": "Some time back it was reported that an alert Maryland police officer saw an Islamic woman in an SUV videotaping a bridge\u2019s support structures. He arrested the driver, Ismail Elbarasse\u2014a Hamas and Muslim Brotherhood operative. An FBI raid on Elbarasse\u2019s home unearthed a trove of Islamic doctrinal books and key Muslim Brotherhood documents\u2014which became evidence in the largest terrorism-financing trial in U.S. history. Islam\u2019s books are \u201cthe real bomb,\u201d Muslim reformer Islam al-Behery said. Its ideology is \u201cits blueprint\u201d for world domination. A document from the Elbarasse raid outlines the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s phased plan to destroy Western civilization from within: Phase One: Secret establishment of leadership. Phase Two: Gradual public profile by infiltrating government, the judiciary, finance, intelligence, police, prisons, military, education and religious institutions. Phase Three: Escalation prior to conflict and confrontation with rulers using mass media. Phase Four: Publically confront the government using political pressure. Weapons training domestically and overseas in anticipation of zero-hour. Phase Five: Seize power to establish the Islamic state. Other documents outline the plan to replace the U.S. Constitution with sharia (Islamic law). Sharia is based on the Quran and other Islamic writings. Moderates see it a spiritual struggle, or outwardly observe it for fear of reprisal. But for radicals, sharia is the legal and political foundation for jihad and global rule, a power play to force Islam on the world. The D.C. based Center for Security Policy calls it a \u201ctotalitarian ideology\u201d controlling all legal, political, military, economic and social life. No other laws or governments may coexist with sharia. It\u2019s primarily political, not religious; though in America it masks itself as a religion to manipulate the First Amendment as a front for seditious activity. The Quran requires all Muslims to wage jihad (holy war) against infidels (non-Muslims). Jihad calls for multiple stages and platforms\u2014violent and pre-violent. An Elbarasse memorandum calls the pre-violent \u201csettlement process\u201d in North America \u201ccivilization jihad\u201d to destroy the Western way of life. In jihad\u2019s final, violent stage, non-Muslims convert or die. Though jihad is obvious in North America and Europe, it\u2019s not limited to the West. The phased plan is a template for radical Muslim subjugation. Indonesia, a secular, mostly moderate Muslim-majority democracy, is a case in point. Its motto, \u201cUnity in Diversity\u201d reflects its six religions and 300 ethnicities. Though religious parties\u2019 gains in national elections have been paltry, locally elected Islamists passed more than 400 sharia ordinances, according to economist.com. Christian incumbent Basuki Tjahaja \u201cAhok\u201d Purnama lost a recent governor\u2019s race when radical Islamists told Muslim voters that Islam forbids voting for Christians. A video of Ahok\u2019s rebuttal was edited to appear he was insulting the Quran. Charged with blasphemy, he lost the election and was sentenced to jail. Ahok\u2019s conviction\u2014accompanied by violent rallies and death threats, shows the chilling influence on pluralism by \u201chardline Islamism that the government and judiciary are reluctant to oppose,\u201d said Time reporter Nicola Smith. In Indonesia, radical Islamists have advanced their plan for global dominance to Phase Four. Then there\u2019s Iran, whose visceral anti-Semitism and poisonous ideology infuses jihad and sharia, but with a twist. The late Ayatollah Khomeini, and his successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, sidestepped Shi\u2019a believe that the Mahdi (12th Imam), a quasi-messianic figure, must return before waging jihad and adopted an ideology promoting a senior Shiite cleric to theocratic political power over Shiites worldwide. Khomeini offered himself as successor to the 12 Imams, thus \u201cinheriting the mantle of leadership directly from Muhammad,\u201d said expert Clare Lopez. Khomeini inserted his doctrine into the 1989 constitution, in which the regime\u2019s objective is global conquest under sharia rule and nuclear dominance is a surefire path to achieve that goal. Iran and its proxies not only menace Israel\u2019s existence and portend regional upheaval, the \u201cbomb\u201d of Islamist ideology threatens the lives and freedoms of every sovereign nation in the world.

{"label": "true", "text": "President Trump holds a joint press conference with Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah of Kuwait. Trump on Thursday also seemingly touted his administration's success against ISIS compared with his predecessor, former President Obama. \"What we do is kill ISIS,\" Trump said of America's involvement in Syria. \"We have done better in eight months in my presidency that was accomplished during the last eight years. ISIS is disappearing rapidly.\" President Trump on Thursday said it would be a \"very sad day\" for North Korea if the U.S. military needed to use force against it. \"Military action would certainly be an option,\" he said during a press conference. \"Nothing is inevitable. I would prefer not going the route of the military, but it could certainly happen.\" \"Our military is stronger now,\" Trump added. \"Each day new and beautiful equipment is delivered, by far the best in the world. Hopefully we don't use it on North Korea. But if we do use it on North Korea, it will be a very sad day for North Korea. I will tell you that North Korea is behaving very badly and it's gotta stop.\" President Trump on Thursday praised Kuwait for its contributions to defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and other terrorist groups. \"The United States is proud to have contributed to the liberation of Kuwait and the friendship we have built together in the years since,\" he said, referencing the First Gulf War from 1990 to 1991. \"We also thank Kuwait for its humanitarian leadership and its partnership in the fight to destroy ISIS,\" Trump added in a joint press conference with Kuwaiti leader Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah. President Trump and Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, the leader of Kuwait, on Thursday are appearing together in a joint press conference after meeting in Washington, D.C. Thursday's meeting comes as Kuwait tries mediating an ongoing diplomatic crisis between Qatar and its Arab neighbors in the Middle East. Trump initially seemed to side with Saudi Arabia on the disagreement, but he then instructed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to back the Kuwaiti mediation initiative.

That ISIS is the world\u2019s biggest terrorist organization, and that Iran has been heavily supporting both Iraq and Syria in fighting ISIS, doesn\u2019t fit into Trump\u2019s narrative, and the fact that ISIS just launched terrorist attacks in Tehran is particularly unwelcome to the US agenda of trying to spin everything wrong in the Middle East as being Iran\u2019s fault. President Trump\u2019s answer to this, then, is to remind everyone that Iran is a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism,\u201d an official designation by the US government which means effectively nothing, and only currently applies to three countries that the US doesn\u2019t like, none of whom has anything to do with ISIS, al-Qaeda, or other major international terrorist groups."}
{"label": "true", "text": "Most of the country condemned Kathy Griffin\u2019s now-infamous photo shoot holding a fake severed head of President Trump. The shocking photo shoot prompted a nationwide outrage and sparked debate over whether or not Griffin should be investigated as a threat to national security. As the Trump family reacted to the photo, it was reported that President Trump\u2019s youngest child\u201411-year-old Barron\u2014had seen the photo while watching the news and became understandably upset. The one thing these so-called artists fail to take into account is the impact their message will have on family members of their targets. It\u2019s incredibly hard to believe that creating images of this violent nature wouldn\u2019t provoke thought into how they will affect families or even the audience. Not only was Griffin\u2019s photo shoot and full admission of wrongdoing completely unacceptable by anyone\u2019s standards, it was disrespectful to victims of terrorism and their families.

With serious reactions to the photo taking place in the United States, opportunists usually crawl out of the woodwork to make a sad attempt at humor. This was a huge fail. Attacking a child who was understandably disturbed by the gruesome image of his father\u2019s mock beheading is a new low in our society. Adding to this creep\u2019s sentiment, Rosie O\u2019Donnell weighed in via her Twitter account, dismissing Barron Trump\u2019s reaction by asking, \u201cDo you think he saw anything about these 2 heroic men who died defending young girls? Hatred promoted by his father?\u201dThis was in reference to the two men who were killed in Oregon defending a Muslim girl from an attack. Regarding which, by the way, President Trump released a statement condemning the act as hatred that has no place in the United States.

{"label": "false", "text": "Alt-Left refers to a loosely defined term to describe left-wing principles, organizations, politicians and activists, encompassing almost everything outside the norm of mainstream democratic liberal politics. Used as both a pejorative and an affirmative, alike, alt-left has been used as a catchall term for far-left political ideologies such as socialism, anarchism, communism as well as Antifa groups. However, because this term remains so undefined and widely denounced amongst the groups associated with it, many of the ideologies within the so-call \"alt-left\" contradict from group to group. Most groups refuse to give the term creedance, and after U.S. President Donald Trump used the term in a 2017 press conference, many have stated that it is a meaningless phrase. On May 29th, 2010, the Swiss political party the Alternative Left (or \"Alternative Linke\") was founded. [1] The party's goals were to unite the far-left political parties of Switzerland under a democratic socialist platform. [2] The party's website reads (translated to English): On August 4th, 2015, Redditor launched zxz242 the subreddit /r/AlternativeLeft. [3] According to the Reddit's purpose, the subreddit is open to all far-left leaning ideas. It reads: On October 12th, 2015, the website AltLeft.com was registered. [4] One month later, Rabbit, the site's owner, posted published his first post, entitled \"A Clockwork Greenshirt \u2013 Introducing the Alt Left.\" According to the site, the AltLeft politically runs \"to the left of Alt-right.\" On April 9th, 2016, the Facebook group \"Alternative Left\" launched. [6] The group's about section reads, \"Leftist but against political correctness. Against SJWs but still socially liberal. Civil and cultural libertarian. Economic leftism.\" As of August 2017, the group has more than 2,000 likes and 2,000 follows. On December 1st, The Washington Post [15] published \"Introducing the \u2018alt-left\u2019: The GOP\u2019s response to its alt-right problem.\" In the article, the Post reports that conservative advocacy group One Nation released a statement under the subject line \"\u201cElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders Lead Alt-Left in Hijacking of Bipartisan Medical Research Bill.\" On April 30th, 2017, YouTuber Tim Pool posted a video entitled \"THE RISE OF THE ALT-LEFT.\" In the video (shown below), Pool draws a distinction between liberals and the \"alt-left,\" asserting that \"alt-left\" groups are fringe groups \"do not do research.\" He says, \"When you're talking to someone who is adamant a Trump hat is triggering and could cause, you know, anxiety to certain marginalized voices that is 'alt-left.' That is this belief almost as extreme as white nationalism.\" As of August 2017, the video has been viewed more than 67,000 views. On August 15th, the New York Times [13] spoke to researchers who said \"there is no such thing as the 'alt-left.'\" In March 2017, Vanity Fair [7] magazine published an article entitled \"Why the Alt-Left Is A Problem Too,\" which pointed to far-left activist groups that supported Bernie Sanders, derided Hillary Clinton and reject \"identity politics\" as a problem for American left-wing politics. On March 6th, New Republic magazine responded to that article in a piece called \"Liberalism Needs the 'Alt-Left,'\" refuting Vanity Fair's assertions. Over the next few months, many centrist and liberal commentators used the term. On August 16th, 2016 MSNBC host Joy Reid tweeted in response to another's post, \"'Alt left' -- well done. Perfect descriptor.\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 120 retweets and 90 likes as of August 2017. Liberal use of the term \"alt left\" has largely been refuted by those within far-left groups. On August 12th, 2017, Twitter @Lukewsavage wrote, \"'Alt left' is a term quite literally designed to draw equivalence between white supremacists and people who want universal healthcare.\" Within four days, the tweet (shown below) has received more than 33,000 retweets and 86,000 likes. Following the violent Unite The Right Rally that left one person dead and dozens injured, President Donald Trump made a series of statements on the event. Initially, in a press conference he said, \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms, this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.\" [8] The following day, Trump delivered another statement. He said, [9] \"Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\" On August 15th, during another press conference at Trump Tower, Trump made more comments on his previous statements, backing up his original words (shown below). He said, \"What about the alt-left that came charging at the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands?\" The reaction to Trump's comments brought the term \"alt left\" into a wider conversation. Many online disagreed with Trump's statements, asserting that he created a false equivalancy between white supremacists and neo-Nazis and those who stand against them. The prevailing take is that \"alt left\" is anyone who opposes Nazism and as America opposed Nazism in World War II, being American makes one \"Alt-Left.\" That day, comedian and actor Patton Osawalt [11] posted a picture of fictional character Indiana Jones punching a Nazi. He captioned the tweet (shown below, left) \"Liberal arts college professor brutalizes Nazi, who has a permit. More alt-left indoctrination.\" The post received more than 53,000 retweets and 127,000 likes. Twitter user @Scott_Gilmore [12] posted a picture of the U.S. military storming the beaches of Normandy, France to fight the Nazis during World War II. He captioned the post \"Alt-left, violently coming at the alt-right, circa 1944.\" The post (shown below, right) received more than 42,000 retweets and 88,000 likes. That day, former head of the Ku Klux Klan, David Duke, [10] tweeted his support of the president's statements. He said, \"Thank you President Trump for your honesty &amp; courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville &amp; condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa.\" The tweet (shown below) received more than 2,900 retweets and 2,000 likes. Trump's use of the term alt-left set off more criticism of the more moderate democrats use of the term. On August 16th, New Republic Magazine [14] published an article entitled \"Liberals Helped Create Trump\u2019s New Bogeyman, the 'Alt-Left.'\" Twitter also pointed out their issues with the term, stating that it creates a fale equivlancy between the left and Nazis."}

The local news you need to start your day Recaptcha requires verification. protected by reCAPTCHA Privacy - Terms Privacy - Terms It should have been obvious from the despicable things he said about Mexican immigrants. It should have been clear from his anti-Muslim rants. It seeped through in his reaction to the deadly march in Charlottesville, Va., putting white supremacists on the same level as civil rights demonstrators. And now it\u2019s emerging again in the debate over Dreamers and Salvadorans who have been protected from deportation. Trump says he wants an $18 billion wall on the border with Mexico, and an end to the visa lottery and \u201cchain migration.\u201d His entire immigration policy seems to have the goalof reducing immigration from non-white countries and somehow boosting immigration from Europe. Trump says he wants to put America First in all matters. But this isn\u2019t the America that many of us cherish \u2013 the nation of immigrants, of the Statue of Liberty. Advocacy groups for immigrants condemned what Trump reportedly said, and Democrats plan to introduce a censure resolutionnext week. Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, tweeted that the president\u2019s comments \u201care further proof that his Make America Great Again agenda is really a Make America White Again agenda.\u201d The White House issued a statementthat didn\u2019t deny his slur, but defended his stand on immigration. Early Friday, Trump, who never apologizes for anything, offered a denial in a series of tweets, though it\u2019s difficult to take him at his word given his track record of lies. \u201cThe language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cWhat was really tough was the outlandish proposal made \u2013 a big setback for DACA!\u201d Later Friday, Trump signed the proclamation for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Reading prepared remarks, he called the civil rights icon a \u201cgreat American hero\u201d who preached racial equality. He refused to answer questions about the uproar, including whether he was racist. To say the scene was jarring doesn\u2019t begin to capture how bizarre it was. This is beyond the daily drama and craziness coming out of this White House, and is already hurting the nation\u2019s standing around the globe. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said Trump\u2019s \u201cvile comments\u201d only \u201cmake the jobs of Americans stationed all over the world harder \u2013 soldiers, diplomats and businesses.\u201d \u201cWe all need to stop pretending that there are no consequences when the most powerful person in the world espouses racist views and gives a wink and a nod to the darkest elements in our society,\u201d Feinstein said in perhaps her toughest statement yet on Trump. \u201cIf the president can\u2019t control himself and lead this country with the authority, dignity and leadership it requires, then he shouldn\u2019t be the president. There\u2019s no room for racism in the Oval Office.\u201d       Yet the sad truth is that all of this may actually solidify Trump\u2019s support among some in his base \u2013 the one-third of Americans who apparently will stand by him no matter what he does or says, no matter how outrageous or unfair or damaging. For me, however, the conclusion is inescapable. He\u2019s a stain on the presidency. He\u2019s a demagogue. And he very well could be a full-on racist. It\u2019s terrible.

{"label": "true", "text": "The German public have, as predicted, kept ahold of nurse. But it is the breakthrough of the AfD into the German Parliament that is causing headlines around the world. Of course the four-year old party\u2019s electoral success is also unsurprising. In elections last September the AfD were elected to representative roles in most of the country\u2019s regional assemblies and beat Merkel\u2019s party into third place in her own constituency. Nevertheless, yesterday\u2019s electoral breakthrough is stunning and the success of this four-year-old party is among other things now causing a predictable rash of 1930s analogies. In a media landscape where very few papers can afford any foreign coverage at all, and a social media landscape which blows around slightly sourced stories with a further splash of personal self-aggrandisement, understanding a phenomenon like the AfD is harder than it should be. Many Europeans find themselves caught. Firstly by the fact that the mainstream political class has done something mad in recent years. As I recently explained at book-length, it is inevitable that things will get complicated when the people in charge of Europe make decisions as appalling as those Angela Merkel made in 2015. What she occasioned in unilaterally opening the continent\u2019s doors to the world may have been humanitarian and may have had some good intentions. But it was also reckless, short-sighted and will cause severe issues for German society for generations to come. Most of that impact \u2013 including the daily reports of crime and sexual assault \u2013 never make it further than the German-language press, and often not even there. What are the public to do when their leaders and media behave like this? One idea is that the public shouldn\u2019t have any choice and should be forced to keep voting for the same old parties anyway. This obviously suits the incumbents, and is best achieved by depicting any and all parties concerned about immigration \u2013 including the mass immigration which people across the political spectrum now say they acknowledge to have been an unrepeatable disaster \u2013 as Nazis, fascists and racists. The incumbent politicians and parties acknowledge they have made mistakes, promise not to repeat those mistakes but insist that anyone wishing to make them pay any political price must recognise that they are voting for a Fourth Reich. It\u2019s a clever, cynical ploy, employed by politicians and much of the media across Germany even more than the UK. Their problem is that at some point the public recognise the ploy. And in particular a moment arrives when the spell-words used by the political mainstream begin to fail. Already terms like \u2018racist\u2019, \u2018Nazi\u2019, \u2018far-right\u2019 have been worn down almost everywhere in Europe. The few people who continue to claim that the public\u2019s concerns are all racist are themselves the ones who now look ridiculous. All they do is ensure that the public care less and less about the words they are called. This has a follow-on problem which is especially worth pondering in Germany. For if the media and political class call everybody a racist and a Nazi for years, and the public can see that these people often called racists and Nazis (Ukip in Britain, for instance) are \u2013 whatever else you might think of them \u2013 clearly not Nazis or racists, then you set up another problem down the road. Anyone who has heard a hundred different people being called Nazis who they knew not to be Nazis is unlikely to have their anti-Nazi antennae intact when the accusation is made for the hundred and first time. This is among the problems that Merkel and co have now set up. The AfD\u2019s platform and pronouncements require close and unbiased attention. This should include having their words and actions reported accurately. To her credit, Merkel \u2013 the great absorber of political difference \u2013 has said that she will work to bring back the people who voted AfD this weekend. This suggests that she might \u2013 just might \u2013 take what is essentially the second broad option for Europe\u2019s political mainstream. That is to stop pretending that anything from a quarter to three-quarters of the general public across Europe are Nazi, fascist, racists who need to be reprogrammed, fought, denounced or ignored. Instead it is to recognise that the concerns of the public are concerns that should be addressed and remedied by the political mainstream. Which isn\u2019t, surely, such a radical idea. We\u2019ll see which path Germany now goes down. More than Germany\u2019s politics will depend on it."}

{"label": "false", "text": "FBI Director James Comey caused a major shakeup in the presidential election with his letter Friday revealing a review of newly-discovered emails related to the FBI previously-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private server. Here is a rundown of what we know (and what we don't) so far: What emails were discovered? Many things remain vague and unknown about the newly uncovered emails. What we do know is that the FBI believes they are \"pertinent\" to its investigation into Clinton's use of a private server during her tenure as secretary of State. According to an official close to the investigation, there are thousands of new emails under review. What we don't know is whether they contain any classified material or could have any bearing on the previous investigation. Could the emails lead to criminal charges against Clinton? That is impossible to know at this point. In a speech Friday, Clinton said she is \"confident\" that the new developments won't change the FBI's recommendation not to prosecute her for improperly handling classified materials. Although Comey could not put a timetable on how long it will take to review the new material, a source tells USA TODAY that is unlikely it will be completed before Election Day. What is the connection to Anthony Weiner? The emails were discovered as part of an investigation into former New York congressman Anthony Weiner, who is suspected of having sexually charged communications with a 15-year-old girl. Investigators came across the emails while looking into devices used by Weiner. Weiner is married to \u2014 and currently separated from \u2014 longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin who had access to the same device or devices. Why did Comey make the review public? In his letter to lawmakers, informing them of the latest developments, Comey said he thought it was important to update them \"in light of my previous testimony,\" which said the investigation had been concluded. Did Attorney General Loretta Lynch approve of Comey's letter to lawmakers? No. Lynch objected to Comey's decision to notify Congress that the FBI was reviewing newly discovered email, an official familiar with the matter told USA TODAY. Lynch based her objection on a long-held Justice Department policy that federal authorities should not take any action that may interfere with an election. Did Lynch try to stop Comey? Yes. Lynch shared her objections just hours before Comey sent the letter, according to USA TODAY's source. The FBI director weighed the attorney general's advice during a spirited discussion of the matter Thursday and early Friday, but in the end, Comey felt compelled to act. When is the election? Tuesday, November 8."}

Earlier that day, he was photographed displaying the symbols of a white nationalist group called Vanguard America, which later denied he was a member. That weekend journalist Shaun King posted a video of several men beating a 20-year-old man named Deandre Harris. King, who was attempting to confirm the identities of the men behind the beating, found that one of the men, Alex Michael Ramos, identifies as Latino. A group called the Atlanta Antifascists then tweeted that Ramos was affiliated with the Atlanta chapter of the far-right organization Proud Boys and the far-right militia called the Georgia Security Force.

The unearthing of this donation led to protests from gay rights activists and the h igh profile call for a boycott of Firefox by dating site OkCupid.com. Eich, as many people in circumstances such as his, was stricken with the sudden desire to \u201cspend more time with his family\u201d and quietly resigned. Regardless of your position on same sex marriage, those activists who led to Eich\u2019s resignation should be ashamed. Their basic message? \u201cYou\u2019d better be tolerant. Or else we will show you a display of true tolerance. By crushing you.\u201d In fact, it is no longer enough to be tolerant. Prior to his resignation, Eich told tech site CNET \u201c[i]f Mozilla cannot continue to operate according to its principles of inclusiveness, where you can work on the mission no matter what your background or other beliefs, I think we\u2019ll probably fail.\u201d In the same interview, he said that he wished for those who were calling for his ouster to know that \u201cwithout getting into my personal beliefs, which I separate from my Mozilla work \u2014 when people learned of the donation, they felt pain. I saw that in friends\u2019 eyes, [friends] who are LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgendered]. I saw that in 2012. I am sorry for causing that pain.\u201d Wow. Eich sounds like an intolerant jerk! No, strike that. He sounds like a dedicated and thoughtful professional who was able to separate his work and personal lives\u2013as well he should have been. But to the activist crowd, it\u2019s not enough that people are tolerant. They must offer affirmation of the LGBT agenda or pay the price. Their much vaunted toleration doesn\u2019t extend to those who might have opposing viewpoints, like Eich. Of course, gay rights activists claim that Eich\u2019s views are not deserving of toleration because he sought to strip them of their rights. This may or may not be the case, but I\u2019d wager that many of them aren\u2019t such dogged defenders of rights when asked about, say, the Second Amendment. And I\u2019m hearing curiously little from these champions of freedom about the fact that 70 percent of California\u2019s African Americans and over 50 percent of Hispanics voted for Prop 8. The uncomfortable fact for the left is that 2008 was the same election in which minority voters pulled the levers in droves for President Obama. Even more uncomfortable? President Obama himself was opposed to same sex marriage in 2008. But, then, it\u2019s not about principle. It\u2019s about ramming through the \u201cright\u201d outcomes. An Associated Press piece about Eich\u2019s resignation asks \u201cwhether the episode undercuts the well-groomed image of Silicon Valley as a marketplace of ideas and diversity of thought, and whether, in this case, the tech world surrendered to political correctness enforced through a public shaming on social media.\u201d Geez, ya think? Andrew Sullivan, the unreliably conservative columnist had this to say: Will [Eich] now be forced to walk through the streets in shame? Why not the stocks? The whole episode disgusts me \u2013 as it should disgust anyone interested in a tolerant and diverse society. If this is the gay rights movement today \u2013 hounding our opponents with a fanaticism more like the religious right than anyone else \u2013 then count me out. If we are about intimidating the free speech of others, we are no better than the anti-gay bullies who came before us. The trite knock at the religious right is to be expected from a regular guest on Bill Maher\u2019s show, but Sullivan is right to call the gay rights activists out on their bullying tactics. And the man has skin in the game, as an openly gay man who has long supported same sex marriage. Kudos to Sullivan for recognizing that support for an issue doesn\u2019t require the squashing of all dissenting viewpoints. Liberals like to mock those who speak of the \u201cgay agenda.\u201d The real agenda, they claim, is for homosexuals to be able to live out their lives in dignity with their loved ones. Such efforts at destroying opposition unfortunately make that more difficult to believe. And activists forget that perhaps next time, they won\u2019t be the ones to define which thought crimes should be prosecuted. In a society which encourages the personal destruction of dissenters, any one of us can develop the desire to \u201cspend more time with family\u201d at any time."}
{"label": "false", "text": "Sex-trafficking is happening in nearly every city and in every state in the U.S. In an all-new Crime Watch Daily in-depth investigation, we take you inside the epidemic that has exploded in recent years. Human trafficking is defined in the simplest terms as the exploitation of another person through force, fraud or coercion. The average age of trafficking victims entering the sex trade world is 13 years old. According to Mary Mazzio's documentary I Am Jane Doe, there are more than 1.6 million homeless or runaway kids on the streets of America, and up to 15 percent of them have fallen victim to sex-trafficking. \"That's hundreds of thousands of children every day, and that's only the homeless and runaway population,\" said Mazzio. HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN LOS ANGELES Crime Watch Daily rode along with a group of undercover deputies from the L.A. County Sheriff's Department as they busted men looking to hook up with underage girls. TRAFFICKING IN HOUSTON In Houston, Texas, one woman is tackling the problem from a very different angle. She's not a sex worker -- not anymore. \"I know what it's like to be more afraid to go home than you are to get in a car with a stranger,\" said former trafficking victim Rebecca Bender. Bender become a victim for nearly six years, traded between three different traffickers in all. She says it was only after police busted her trafficker for tax evasion that she was able to finally break free. But it would take years to get her life back on track. After a decade free from the life, Rebecca Bender is about to go back on the streets, posing as a sex worker to expose just how big the problem may be in your town. TRAFFICKING DELUNA Much like the heroin epidemic we are now facing, sex-trafficking is a massive problem in the United States. These are not just women being brought in from other countries. We're talking about teens, or even younger, being recruited from middle schools and high schools in just about every city in America. So far we've taken you undercover on sex-trafficking stings and you've see some cities that have become sex-slave hubs. Crime Watch Daily interviews a young woman lured into the sex-trade world and how it's now landed her in prison doing serious time. Lizette Deluna ran from abuse at home into the arms of a sex-trafficker. Now she's in prison in Texas, convicted of trafficking herself. How did she get there? She share her journey exclusively with Crime Watch Daily. TRAFFICKING IN DEKALB COUNTY Crime Watch Daily teams up with law enforcement agencies all over the country who are cracking down on the illegal sex trade business. On the streets of Georgia, we encountered an alleged pimp that was more than happy to talk to us. TARGETING ONLINE CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING No matter where we went, there seemed to be one name that kept coming up: Backpage.com. Operating in more than 900 cities worldwide, the online classifieds website commands, by some estimates, more than 80 percent of all online sex ad revenues. And it's through those ads that many allege the company has knowingly permitted the sale of underage children. \"The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has stated that at least 73 percent of all reports to them, of online sex trafficking, where does it happen? Backpage.com,\" said I Am Jane Doe filmmaker Mary Mazzio. Just recently, under pressure from the U.S. Senate, Backpage did shut down its adult section in the United States. The company itself may be worth more than $500 million, and by some estimates, 99 percent of that global income comes from illicit ads. For their part, Backpage claims no responsibility for what they call third-party content. But in a series of new civil suits brought by former victims, attorney Erik Bauer claims Backpage actually helped edit the ads to make them appear more legitimate. Not long ago, Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer, along with former owners Michael Lacey and James Larkin were actually brought up on pimping charges by former California Attorney General and current U.S. Senator Kamala Harris. Crime Watch Daily Correspondent Melissa McCarty was there during their latest arraignment. They ignored our questions, but considering the serious nature of the charges, we had to keep trying. The judge granted Crime Watch Daily exclusive access inside the courtroom for the proceedings, where ultimately the defense requested a delay. While they wait for the next hearing, Carl Ferrer is released on a $500,000 bond, while Larkin and Lacey get out on $250,000 bonds. \"We have lost all common sense,\" said Mary Mazzio. \"If you had a site that said 'Murder for Hire,' do you seriously think the American public would stand for that, that a federal jurist would stand for that? But because it's prostitution, it's 'Pretty Woman,' it's the victimless crime, it's the world's oldest profession, you know what -- not that big of a deal.\" So is there a solution? Can awareness alone help stop the problem? And just how many more lives will be stolen for sex? RESCUING A TRAFFICKED DAUGHTER The parent and the pimp. How far will one dad go to rescue his girl from the clutches of a criminal? \"Say no to drugs. Stay in school.\" These are the things brad smith thought to teach his daughter. But there was one threat that never even crossed his mind. This is not a victimless crime. And to all the \"johns\" out there feeding the illegal sex trade, you can be sure that law enforcement and Crime Watch Daily will not stop until you are in handcuffs. RESOURCES The National Child Traumatic Stress Network has resources for mental health professionals, law enforcement personnel, health care professionals, and survivors on the signs of trafficking and services for human trafficking survivors. Children of the Night is a privately funded non-profit organization established in 1979 and dedicated to rescuing America\u2019s children from the ravages of prostitution. GenerateHope provides a safe place for survivors of sex trafficking to be restored through long-term housing, healing, psychotherapy and education. Since recovery from sexual exploitation is a long-term process, GenerateHope provides individualized support to work through past trauma until the women reach the ability to live independently and become a positive influence on their communities and future generations.

{"label": "false", "text": "Medical science is constantly making cancer breakthroughs, however there\u2019s an extensive process to bring treatments to the public. After making a discovery in the lab and performing tests, there are human clinical trials that require oversight by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before approval. That being said, there are some promising new treatments (with some currently still in the investigational stages) targeting cancer, and they could prove valuable to millions of patients in the U.S. and beyond in the future. Here are six experimental cancer treatments that are catching attention from the medical world\u2026 BestMedicalDegrees.com outlines this experimental use of heat to target tumors. This technique can zero in on specific areas or heat the whole body, which will break down protein cells within a tumor and cause them to die, notes the source. While the treatment can potentially blast away existing cells, it could also help prevent new ones from forming. \u201cHyperthermia Therapy is very exciting because, if it turns out to be a viable treatment, this will destroy the cancerous tumors from the inside out and hinder its ability to infect more healthy cells,\u201d adds the source. Also called adoptive cell transfer, the experimental technique aims to improve the ability of a patient\u2019s natural T-cells (lymphocytes for immunity) to fight cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute. Doctors can take the best and most active T-cells that have invaded a tumor and extract them to multiply in a lab \u2013 the patient\u2019s immune cells are then wiped out and the lab-grown cells are re-infused back to them, it adds. There are variations of this treatment, and the first use of it targeted metastatic melanoma, which can spread quickly through the body. Modified T-cells are also being looked at to treat other solid tumors as well as hematologic cancers (cancers of the blood), it adds. ABC News says in an article that this therapy consists of drugs that are aimed at destroying only specific cancer cells, without negatively affecting healthy cells as many existing treatments do. \u201cThus, people taking the drugs too often suffer horrible side effects on top of whatever havoc the cancer itself is already wreaking,\u201d notes the source. ABC says the leading drug in this new therapy is called Glivec (or STI571). It is designed to treat a specific form a leukemia called chronic myeloid leukemia, which has about 7,000 new cases per year in the U.S., adds the source. \u201cDoctors are extremely hopeful that the drug could provide a model for similar drugs to treat cancers affecting many thousands more people,\u201d it notes. The National Cancer Institute detailed a potential new cancer therapy in early 2017, which looks to target ovarian cancer cells. The basics are that tumor cells \u201cexpress\u201d a protein called TNFR2, which can prevent a patient\u2019s natural immune system from attacking a tumor. Researchers have developed new antibodies that target TNFR2, as well as having the ability to kill ovarian cancer cells, thus \u201ckilling two birds with one stone,\u201d notes the source. The team found that ovarian cancer cells express an abnormal level of TNFR2 that can promote tumor growth \u2013 and the source points out other types of cancers, such as colon and kidney cancer, also show unusual TNFR2 production. This therapy, which the American Brain Tumor Association said was recently approved by the FDA for glioblastoma (an aggressive brain cancer), usually follows surgery and radiation therapy, adds the source. It involves ceramic discs called transducer arrays to deliver electromagnetic energy to the scalp. \u201cThese electrical fields exert selective toxicity in proliferating cells thereby halting cell division and destroying the cancer cells,\u201d notes the source. While the treatment is used in conjunction with oral chemotherapy drugs for glioblastoma (GBM), it can be used on its own to target recurrent (returning) GBM when other options have been exhausted, according to the source. Usually, having a virus is a bad thing. However, this therapy essentially involves introducing a virus to cancer cells that leave healthy cells alone, notes StandUp2Cancer.org. The virus only seeks out cancer cells due to their genetic mutation that normal cells don\u2019t have, it explains. One treatment in particular is called Reolysin, developed by a Canadian biotechnology company, notes the source. The site notes that almost 300-patients \u201cwith various forms of cancer\u201d in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. have been treated with this therapy, which infects cancer cells and causes them to explode. Apparently, side effects (such as a low-grade fever) are a lot milder than those associated with chemotherapy and radiation, it adds."}

{"label": "true", "text": "A remarkable thing happened recently. You might have missed it, because while it happened in plain sight, it also happened in increments. You had to put the pieces together to appreciate the magnitude of it. You see, America repudiated its president. This, of course, was in response to that pathetic performance in the wake of the tragedy in Charlottesville, Va., when he suggested moral equivalence between white supremacists and those who protest them. In response, America \u2014 a pretty broad swath of it, at least \u2014 has condemned him. The reference is not to the shellacking he took from pundits or the reprovals of GOP leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan. These things were to be expected. But you did not expect the Chairman and CEO of Merck to quit the president\u2019s American Manufacturing Council. And Ken Frazier\u2019s departure, which he framed as \u201ca matter of personal conscience,\u201d was just the opening salvo. He was followed through the door by members of that panel and others. By week\u2019s end, two presidential business advisory groups had ceased to exist and plans for a third had been scrapped. Members of the President\u2019s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities also resigned en masse. Meantime, Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s club and de facto presidential getaway in Florida, saw a rash of charities canceling their fundraising events. The Washington Post listed the Salvation Army, the American Red Cross, Susan G. Komen and the American Cancer Society among those who have chosen to hold their galas elsewhere. And there is yet more. Bob Corker, a respected Republican senator who has heretofore sought to engage with the president, raised sharp questions not just about Trump\u2019s competence, but also his \u201cstability,\u201d and called for \u201cradical changes\u201d in the White House. Five military chiefs also spoke out against the bigotry in Charlottesville, in a striking reproach of their commander. Graduates of Liberty University called on fellow alumni to return their diplomas to protest LU president Jerry Falwell Jr.\u2019s support for Trump. And it was announced that the president would not be attending the Kennedy Center Honors in December, nor host the traditional White House reception for the five honorees after three of them had spoken of boycotting the event. And really: How toxic are you when Lionel Richie doesn\u2019t want to shake your hand? It seems that a great many Americans reached a moment of decision and reacted as you would have hoped. Trump and his apologists and enablers should take note, because this does not bode well for them. For all its powers of law making, war making, budget drafting, and diplomacy, the presidency also embodies the power of moral suasion. A president uses what Theodore Roosevelt called \u201cthe bully pulpit\u201d \u2014 the honor and prestige of his office \u2014 to stand for what is right and remind us to do likewise. Problematically, that office is occupied now by a man with no moral compass, a man whose only true North is self. So what happened was sadly predictable. What was not predictable was this chorus of castigation from such a wide spectrum of American life. The stunning rebuke offers heartening evidence that we have not yet completely abandoned who and what we are supposed to be. Again, this is a moment of decision. Those who chose to separate themselves from Trump declared their values \u2014 and character. Those who supported him did, too."}

Is the former Commander-in-Chief hiding something? The move has \u201chistorians scratching their heads.\u201d Fox News report: The Obama Foundation is taking an unconventional approach to the presidential center and library being planned in Chicago. It\u2019s opting to host a digital archive of President Barack Obama\u2019s records, but not keep his hard-copy manuscripts and letters and other documents onsite. That means no thumbing through the ex-president\u2019s correspondence on the health care fight or first drafts of his State of the Union addresses. The decision has historians scratching their heads. \u201cAll archivists are waiting to see how this will work, because we are all struggling with how to make things available digitally,\u201d Peggy Glowacki, a manuscripts librarian at the Richard J. Daley Library at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told the Chicago Tribune. An interesting piece of information to note is evidence surrounding Susan Rice\u2019s role in the \u2018unmasking\u2019 probe have been moved to the future library. The documents were moved to the Obama Library and under the Presidential Records Act, Presidential records remain closed to the public for five years after an administration has left office. President of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton said Wednesday on Fox &amp; Friends that President Trump can obtain these records from the Obama Presidential Library because they are federal records. Fox &amp; Friends host Steve Doocy said that the President himself could obtain the records if he were to ask for them. Tom Fitton: \u201cYes, they are still federal records. They are under the control of the national archives and he can get \u2019em. If he needs them, then the President can conduct his official duties he can get them, Subpoenas issued by Congress can get them. Special Counsel Mueller, if he decides to actually investigate real crimes like the unmasking, the illicit surveillance, the leaking\u2013he could get them if he issued subpoenas. There are options to get these records and they need to be taken because there could be elements of the records in the other agencies, but these are key White House records about what the White House was up to and that to me is as important as anything else.\u201d Sponsored Sponsored"}

{"label": "false", "text": "Postpartum depression has become more visible as celebrity moms including Brooke Shields, Drew Barrymore and Chrissy Teigen have publicly shared their struggles with feeling sad and hopeless after birth. But when a father \u2013 Adam Busby, from reality TV show \u201cOutDaughtered\u201d \u2013 recently opened up about his own postpartum depression, he received instant backlash, including comments telling him to \u201cman up.\u201d Despite the skepticism, postpartum depression in fathers is very real, with estimates that around 10 percent of men report symptoms of depression following the birth of a child, about double the typical rate of depression in males. Postpartum depression in women has been linked with hormonal shifts, but the role of hormones in men\u2019s postpartum depression has been unknown. In an attempt to solve this mystery, my colleagues and I recently tested whether men\u2019s levels of the hormone testosterone are related to their postpartum depression risk during early parenthood. We found that men\u2019s testosterone levels might predict not only their own postpartum depression risk, but their partner\u2019s depression risk as well. Testosterone levels in flux through life changes Testosterone is an androgen hormone, responsible for the development and maintenance of male secondary sex characteristics. It promotes muscle mass and body hair growth, and motivates sexual arousal and competitive behavior. Many studies have found that testosterone dips in new fathers across the animal kingdom. Among animals that engage in the biparental care of offspring \u2013 Mongolian gerbils, Djungarian hamsters, California mice and cotton-top tamarins \u2013 males show lower testosterone levels following the birth of pups. Human males also often show declines in testosterone around the birth of their infants. In one of the largest studies of testosterone and fatherhood, anthropologist Lee Gettler and his colleagues followed over 600 single men in the Philippines for about five years. If men became partnered fathers during that time, their testosterone levels decreased more than the men who stayed single. Gettler also found that fathers who spent more time with their children showed lower testosterone, suggesting that testosterone may be suppressed by paternal caregiving. Along similar lines, psychologist Robin Edelstein and I found that men assessed repeatedly over their partner\u2019s pregnancy showed declining testosterone levels from early to late pregnancy. Men whose testosterone dropped more dramatically were more likely to report postpartum commitment and investment in their romantic relationships with their partners. Researchers still haven\u2019t identified exactly what causes men\u2019s testosterone to change over the transition to parenthood. Possible suspects include proximity to the partner or infant, increased stress or disrupted sleep and exercise routines. Lower testosterone, higher depression Previous research has linked testosterone with men\u2019s depression levels in general. Low testosterone may contribute to the feelings of lethargy and disinterest in normally pleasurable activities that characterize depression. In fact, some psychiatrists have even suggested prescribing testosterone supplements to treat depression in men. However, no studies had specifically looked at the potential role of testosterone in fathers\u2019 postpartum depression. My colleagues and I analyzed data from the Community Child Health Research Network, a National Institutes of Health-funded study of new parents\u2019 health and well-being. The study recruited moms after the birth of an infant and followed them for several years, along with their partners. At one of the study sites, in Lake County, Illinois, men also provided saliva samples for testosterone analysis when their infants were around nine months old. Both moms and dads reported on their symptoms of depression several times across the first few years of parenthood. We found that dads with lower testosterone reported feeling more depressed. This fits with other research into how testosterone and depression work together. But ours is the first study to observe this relationship specifically in fathers of infants. Given that many men show drops in testosterone over the transition to parenthood, this finding may help explain why the postpartum period is such a high-risk time for depression in men. An unexpected side effect \u2013 for the moms We were surprised when we examined links between men\u2019s testosterone and their partners\u2019 depression. Yes, low testosterone seemed to put men at higher risk for depressive symptoms. But men\u2019s levels had the opposite effect for their partners: Women with lower-testosterone partners actually reported fewer symptoms of depression. Why would that be? We tested one possible explanation by looking at how women rated their relationships. It turned out that moms paired with low-testosterone men reported higher relationship satisfaction, and their higher relationship satisfaction predicted lower rates of depressive symptoms. In other words, having a low-testosterone mate might make for a better-quality relationship, in turn reducing the likelihood that women will become depressed. We know social support from a partner can protect women against developing postpartum depression, so our finding fits with that research. Lower-testosterone men may be more dedicated to their relationships or spend more time with children, helping to relieve some of the pressure on moms. At around 15 months postpartum, we also checked moms\u2019 ratings of whether their partners hurt, threatened, yelled at or insulted them. If men had higher testosterone, moms reported higher levels of intimate partner aggression about six months later. Testosterone is associated with more aggressive and competitive behavior. Our finding shows a potential dark side to high testosterone in the postpartum period. Dads also told us about their parenting stress at 15 months postpartum, reporting on emotions such as feeling trapped by parenting responsibilities, believing their children made too many demands on them and lacking warm feelings toward their children. At first, we didn\u2019t find a link between men\u2019s testosterone levels and their parenting stress. But after we statistically controlled for the relationship between low testosterone and depression, we saw that higher testosterone put men at greater risk of experiencing problems in the parenting relationship. This result suggests that, once you adjust for their potentially lower risk of depression, high-testosterone men may find parenting to be more stressful. A happy medium for testosterone? Our results suggest that fathers of infants might be at risk at both sides of the postpartum testosterone spectrum. At low levels, they might be more vulnerable to depression. But at high levels, they might have less satisfying and more aggressive relationships, less happy partners and more parenting stress. In terms of resilience to depression and stress, men with average levels of postpartum testosterone seemed to fare best. Our findings reveal that men\u2019s postpartum testosterone has a complex relationship with family health. From an evolutionary perspective, lower testosterone during the transition to parenthood may help motivate men to invest in their family. In the animal kingdom, lower-testosterone males spend more time with infant pups and show less aggression toward them. So it makes sense that human males would show shifts in testosterone as they adapt to parenthood. But these shifts may make men more vulnerable to mood disorder symptoms. Perhaps this is because lower-testosterone men are taking a more hands-on role in the family and helping more with infant care. Their contributions are great news from the family\u2019s perspective, but may put men at heightened risk of some of the same depressive symptoms that many new mothers face. After all, caring for infants is hard, draining work. In modern industrialized societies like the United States, many new parents lack the extended family support networks that can help lighten the burden of childcare. And in the U.S., paternity leave is a rarity, and many dads struggle with family-unfriendly work arrangements that drain time and energy. Just as new moms can feel overwhelmed and isolated after spending long hours tending to their babies, so too can dads. If new dads (or moms) are experiencing depressed moods after the birth of their infants, they can take some comfort in the fact that these feelings are normal \u2013 and may even be rooted in our evolutionary biology. There\u2019s no shame in seeking help, whether it\u2019s talking to a friend, prioritizing sleep and exercise, or visiting a therapist. Postpartum depression affects the whole family and should be taken seriously.

{"label": "false", "text": "The early voting period in Florida has come to an end, and the final results are now in. Early voting in Florida began on October 24th, and it concluded on November 6th. According to data released by the Florida Department of State\u2019s Division of Elections, 6.4 million Floridians voted early this year. In the end, the Democrats were able to come away from early voting with the advantage. A total of 2,558,000 votes were cast by registered Democrats, and 2,471,000 votes were cast by registered Republicans. This translates into 39.85 percent of the vote going to the Democrats, and 38.49 percent of it going to the Republicans. In total, 49.7 percent of the state\u2019s entire population of registered voters have already voted. This turnout of 6.4 million voters is a significant increase compared to four years ago, when only 4.4 million votes were cast early. The Democrats hold a lead going into Election Day, but their lead is significantly smaller than it was four years ago. In 2012, Democrats scored 43 percent of the early vote in Florida, and Republicans scored 40 percent. In the end, Barack Obama won Florida, but it was a tight race, with the president defeating Mitt Romney by a margin of just 0.88 percentage points. Democratic turnout tends to be high in early voting, and Republican turnout tends to be high on Election Day. So the fact that the Democrats don\u2019t have as large a lead as they did four years ago may spell trouble for Hillary Clinton. This year, about 1.2 million of the ballots cast came from those not affiliated with any of the two major parties. This translates into 19.2 percent of the early vote. It\u2019s unclear who these voters selected, but many polls have suggested that they tend to gravitate towards Donald Trump. In a recent CBS News poll, independent voters favored Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, 47 percent to 34 percent, and another Remington Research survey showed Trump winning among unaffiliated voters 49 percent to 36 percent. Although the number of votes cast by Democrats is down, good news for Hillary Clinton is the fact that Hispanic turnout in Florida is up this year. According to The Wall Street Journal, about twice as many Florida Hispanics have voted early compared to 2012. However, African American turnout was down 11 percent this year, according to McClatchy DC.
